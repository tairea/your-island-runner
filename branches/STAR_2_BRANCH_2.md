# Branch: Game Design Document

**Branch Objective**: Document your game vision in a mini Game Design Document (GDD) that professional studios use to plan projects

**Why This Branch?**: Real game developers create design documents before building. This skill helps you think through your game systematically and communicates your vision to others.
