# Branch: Advanced Obstacle Mechanics

**Branch Objective**: Build impressive dynamic obstacles like spinning hazards, falling platforms, and timed sequences using TweenService

**Why This Branch?**: TweenService creates smooth, professional-looking movements. These techniques separate basic obstacle courses from memorable experiences.
