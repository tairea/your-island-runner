# Branch: Advanced Satellite Research

**Branch Objective**: Gather diverse reference materials using multiple satellite tools and historical imagery to create a more authentic island representation

**Why This Branch?**: Different mapping tools reveal different details. Google Earth shows 3D terrain, OpenStreetMap shows paths and labels, and historical imagery shows how places change over time.
