# Branch: Collectible Systems

**Branch Objective**: Implement a collectible system with pickups, counters, and optional paths that reward exploration

**Why This Branch?**: Collectibles add replay value and reward curious players who explore off the main path. Many popular Roblox games use this mechanic.
