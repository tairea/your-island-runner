# Mission 4.2: Touched Events

**Learning Objective**: Write a script that responds when players touch a part

## Summary
Time to make your game interactive! In this mission, you'll learn about events - code that runs when something specific happens. You'll write a script that detects when a player touches a part, making your game respond to player actions for the first time.

## Key Concepts
- Events are things that happen in your game (touching, clicking, jumping, etc.)
- The Touched event fires when something touches a part
- Functions are blocks of code that run when called
- Parameters are information passed to functions
- Scripts can be attached directly to parts

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Mission 4.1 (Scripts and Output)
- Understanding of print() statements
- Ability to create and edit scripts
