# Mission 4.1: Scripts and Output

**Learning Objective**: Create a Script, write print(), and find it in the Output window

## Summary
Your first steps into coding! In this mission, you'll create your very first script in Roblox Studio, write a simple line of code that sends a message, and learn how to see that message in the Output window. This is where every coder begins their journey.

## Key Concepts
- Scripts are containers for code that make things happen in your game
- The `print()` function sends messages to the Output window
- The Output window is your debugging tool - it shows messages and errors
- Every line of code has a specific purpose and syntax

## Prerequisites
- Roblox Studio installed and open
- Your island runner project from previous stars
- Basic familiarity with the Explorer panel
