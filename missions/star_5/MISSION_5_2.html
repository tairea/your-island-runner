    <title>Mission 5.2: Landmark Zone 3</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="mission-hook">
        <h1>The Midpoint Test</h1>
        <p>You've built two zones. Players are settling into your game's rhythm. They understand what you're about. Zone 3 is where many games fail—it's easy to run out of ideas and just repeat what worked before. But you're not building "just another zone." You're building the midpoint, the place that determines whether players keep going or quit.</p>
        <p>Zone 3 needs to surprise them. Not with randomness, but with something new that still feels like it belongs in your game. Maybe it's a new obstacle type. Maybe it's a dramatic visual change. Maybe it's a difficulty spike that demands mastery of skills learned in Zones 1 and 2.</p>
        <p>Your mission: create a landmark zone that proves you have more tricks up your sleeve.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mission-objective">
        <h2>Mission Objective</h2>
        <p>Build Landmark Zone 3 with a new obstacle pattern or challenge type that feels fresh while maintaining connection to the overall game design.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mission-content-main">
        <h2>The Innovation Challenge</h2>
        <p>Before building, ask yourself: what haven't I done yet? Review Zones 1 and 2. Write down what obstacle types you've already used:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Simple gaps between platforms?</li>
            <li>Tight corridors?</li>
            <li>Vertical climbs?</li>
            <li>Small platform parkour?</li>
            <li>Timed sequences?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Now pick something different. Here are ideas organized by what makes them unique:</p>

        <h3>New Idea 1: The Spiral</h3>
        <p>Build platforms that spiral upward around a central point. Players circle around as they climb. This creates a 3D navigation challenge—they need to understand where they are in space, not just move forward. Great if your previous zones were flat and linear.</p>

        <h3>New Idea 2: The Choice Path</h3>
        <p>Create a fork where two paths diverge. One path is shorter but harder (smaller platforms, bigger gaps). The other is longer but easier (larger platforms, more safe spots). Both paths lead to the same checkpoint. This introduces strategy—do you risk the hard path for speed or take the safe route?</p>

        <h3>New Idea 3: The Descending Challenge</h3>
        <p>Most zones go up or stay flat. What if this one goes down? Build a series of platforms that descend into a pit. The challenge: you can't see what's below until you jump. Requires trust and precision. Place the checkpoint at the bottom.</p>

        <h3>New Idea 4: The Obstacle Course</h3>
        <p>Instead of gaps between platforms, fill the space with obstacles to navigate around. Build walls that jut out, forcing players to walk around them. Add low barriers they must jump over. Create a confined path where precise movement matters more than big jumps.</p>

        <h3>New Idea 5: The Size Shift</h3>
        <p>Make this zone either much bigger or much smaller than previous zones. Huge platforms with massive gaps, or tiny platforms requiring pixel-perfect jumps. The scale change alone makes it feel new.</p>

        <div class="try-it-box">
            <h3>Try It: Pick Your Innovation</h3>
            <p>Choose ONE of the ideas above (or create your own). Write it down. Sketch a rough layout on paper or visualize it. The key: commit to making this zone feel different from Zones 1 and 2.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Building with Purpose</h2>
        <p>Let's build a specific example: The Spiral. This teaches 3D thinking and looks impressive.</p>

        <h3>Step 1: Build the Center</h3>
        <p>Create a large cylinder or tower that will be your spiral's center point. This is visual reference—players will see it and understand they're circling it. Make it tall (60+ studs) and anchor it.</p>

        <h3>Step 2: Build the First Platform</h3>
        <p>Create the landing platform where players arrive from Zone 2. Position it at the base of your central tower, offset to one side. Make it safe and large (10x10 studs).</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Build the Spiral Path</h3>
        <p>Now build platforms that circle the tower going upward:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Create a platform 8 studs away from the first, rotated 45 degrees around the tower</li>
            <li>Raise it 4 studs higher than the landing platform</li>
            <li>Create the next platform, rotated another 45 degrees, 4 studs higher</li>
            <li>Continue this pattern—each platform rotates around and goes up</li>
            <li>After one full rotation (8 platforms), you should be about 32 studs higher</li>
            <li>Build 2-3 full rotations total</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 4: Add Kill Bricks</h3>
        <p>Place kill brick parts in the gaps between spiral platforms. Make them large enough to catch falling players but small enough to be visible as danger. Use your kill brick script from Star 4.</p>

        <h3>Step 5: Add the Checkpoint</h3>
        <p>At the top of the spiral, build a large final platform and place your checkpoint. Make this platform big—players just did something hard and need space to celebrate.</p>

        <div class="tips-box">
            <h3>Spiral Building Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consistent spacing</strong>: Keep rotation angle and height increase the same for each platform. This creates predictable rhythm.</li>
                <li><strong>Platform size</strong>: Start with 6x6 platforms. If it's too easy, shrink to 5x5. If too hard, expand to 7x7.</li>
                <li><strong>Visual guides</strong>: Add small parts or arrows pointing to the next platform. Players can get disoriented in 3D.</li>
                <li><strong>Test the camera</strong>: The camera might fight you on spirals. Playtest to ensure players can see where they're going.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Alternative Build: The Choice Path</h2>
        <p>If spirals aren't your style, here's how to build a choice path zone:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Build the landing platform (10x10 studs)</li>
            <li>Build two platforms ahead of it, positioned left and right (the fork)</li>
            <li><strong>Left path (hard)</strong>: Build 8-10 small platforms (4x4 studs) with 6-7 stud gaps</li>
            <li><strong>Right path (easy)</strong>: Build 12-15 larger platforms (7x7 studs) with 5 stud gaps</li>
            <li>Both paths should take roughly the same time, just different skill levels</li>
            <li>Build a final platform where both paths merge</li>
            <li>Place checkpoint on the merge platform</li>
            <li>Add kill bricks under all platforms</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The beauty of choice paths: they accommodate different skill levels. Struggling players take the easy route. Confident players challenge themselves with the hard route. Everyone wins.</p>

        <div class="try-it-box">
            <h3>Try It: Signaling Choice</h3>
            <p>If you build a choice path, make the choice obvious. Color the hard path red and easy path green. Or place signs using text labels. Players should know what they're choosing.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Difficulty Calibration</h2>
        <p>Zone 3 is your midpoint. It should be harder than Zones 1 and 2, but not brutal. Here's a calibration guide:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Zone 1</strong>: Takes 3-5 attempts for new players to complete</li>
            <li><strong>Zone 2</strong>: Takes 5-8 attempts to complete</li>
            <li><strong>Zone 3</strong>: Should take 8-12 attempts to complete</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Test this yourself. Delete your checkpoint progress and run through from Zone 1 to Zone 3. Count your deaths in Zone 3. If you're dying 20+ times and you built it, players will struggle too much. Adjust.</p>

        <h2>Visual Identity</h2>
        <p>By Zone 3, players should see a visual progression. Each zone should have its own color scheme or style. This creates a sense of journey.</p>

        <p>Ideas for Zone 3 visual identity:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Color theme</strong>: Pick a color palette you haven't used. If Zones 1-2 were blues and greens, try oranges and purples.</li>
            <li><strong>Material choice</strong>: Use a different material. If you've used SmoothPlastic, try Neon or Metal for Zone 3.</li>
            <li><strong>Decorative elements</strong>: Add non-functional parts that look cool. Floating spheres, pillars, arches—things that create atmosphere.</li>
            <li><strong>Lighting prep</strong>: While you won't add lighting until Star 6, build this zone thinking about it. Leave space for spotlights or ambient glow.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="tips-box">
            <h3>The Rule of Three</h3>
            <p>In game design, three is a magic number. Players see two zones, they start to predict patterns. Three zones confirms those patterns. You're teaching players how your game works. Zone 1 introduces, Zone 2 reinforces, Zone 3 expands. Keep this rhythm in mind.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Playtesting Protocol</h2>
        <p>Testing Zone 3 requires fresh eyes. You've been building for a while—you know this zone too well. Here's how to test effectively:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Wait 10 minutes</strong>: After building, take a break. Get water, stretch, do something else. Come back fresh.</li>
            <li><strong>Full playthrough</strong>: Start from the spawn point, run through Zones 1, 2, and 3. Does Zone 3 feel like a natural progression or a sudden spike?</li>
            <li><strong>Count deaths</strong>: Track where you die most. If one obstacle kills you 80% of the time, it's probably too hard.</li>
            <li><strong>Check the clock</strong>: Time how long Zone 3 takes. Aim for 40-60 seconds for a successful run. If it's taking 90+ seconds, it might be too long.</li>
            <li><strong>The fun test</strong>: Are you having fun? If running through your own zone feels like a chore, players will hate it. Good zones are fun even when you fail.</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="try-it-box">
            <h3>Try It: The Perspective Shift</h3>
            <p>Playtest with different camera angles. Zoom in close, zoom out far. Does your zone work from all views? If it only works from one specific camera angle, that's a design flaw. Fix it.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Common Zone 3 Mistakes</h2>
        <p>Avoid these traps:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Too much innovation</strong>: Don't make Zone 3 completely alien. It should feel new but still part of the same game.</li>
            <li><strong>Copying Zones 1-2</strong>: The opposite problem. If Zone 3 is just "more of the same," players will check out mentally.</li>
            <li><strong>Difficulty spike</strong>: Making Zone 3 way harder than Zone 2 frustrates players. Ramp difficulty gradually.</li>
            <li><strong>Visual chaos</strong>: Adding too many decorations or colors. Keep it clean and readable.</li>
            <li><strong>Unclear path</strong>: Players should always know where to go next. If they're confused, add visual guides.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final Checks</h2>
        <p>Before moving on, verify:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Zone 3 introduces something new (pattern, visual style, or challenge type)</li>
            <li>All parts are anchored</li>
            <li>Kill bricks are scripted and CanCollide = false</li>
            <li>Checkpoint is placed and working</li>
            <li>You can complete Zones 1-3 in sequence without game-breaking bugs</li>
            <li>Zone 3 is harder than Zone 2 but not impossibly so</li>
            <li>Visual style is distinct from previous zones</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
