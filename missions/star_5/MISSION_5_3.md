# Mission 5.3: Moving Platforms

**Learning Objective**: Implement TweenService to create moving platforms that add dynamic challenge to one landmark zone

## Summary
Static platforms are great, but moving platforms bring your game to life. Using TweenService, you'll create platforms that move smoothly between positions, forcing players to time their jumps and think dynamically. This is a major upgrade to your game's complexity and polish.

## Key Concepts
- TweenService fundamentals
- CFrame positioning and manipulation
- Tween information (time, easing style, direction)
- Creating looping animations
- Dynamic obstacle timing

## Prerequisites
- Completed Mission 5.2 (Landmark Zone 3)
- Basic Lua scripting knowledge from Star 4
- Understanding of part properties
- Familiarity with the Explorer and Properties panels
