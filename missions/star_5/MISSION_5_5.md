# Mission 5.5: Flow Testing

**Learning Objective**: Playtest the complete island runner course and systematically adjust difficulty curves, pacing, and challenge balance for optimal player experience

## Summary
Building is one thing. Refining is another. You have five complete zones, but the real work begins now: playing through your game repeatedly, identifying problems, and making surgical improvements. This is how professional game developers work—build, test, refine, repeat.

## Key Concepts
- Systematic playtesting methodology
- Difficulty curve analysis
- Identifying and fixing frustration points
- Pacing and flow optimization
- Iterative design process

## Prerequisites
- All five landmark zones complete (Zones 1-5)
- All checkpoints and kill bricks functional
- Moving platforms implemented
- Basic understanding of game difficulty progression
