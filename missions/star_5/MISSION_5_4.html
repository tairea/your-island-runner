    <div class="mission-hook">
        <h1>The Final Gauntlet</h1>
        <p>You've built three zones. You've mastered moving platforms. You understand checkpoints, kill bricks, and TweenService. Now it's time to bring everything together in your final two zones.</p>
        <p>Zone 4 is your difficulty peak—the hardest challenge in your game. It's where skilled players prove themselves. Zone 5 is your conclusion—still hard, but also a victory lap, a showcase of your best ideas, and a satisfying ending to the journey.</p>
        <p>These zones will define whether your game is memorable or forgettable. No pressure, but this is where you leave your mark.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mission-objective">
        <h2>Mission Objective</h2>
        <p>Build Landmark Zones 4 and 5, creating a difficulty peak and satisfying conclusion while maintaining variety and quality throughout your entire island runner.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mission-content-main">
        <h2>The Complete Arc</h2>
        <p>Before building, understand the full arc of your five zones:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Zone 1</strong>: Introduction. Simple, teaches basic mechanics.</li>
            <li><strong>Zone 2</strong>: Escalation. Introduces new patterns, slightly harder.</li>
            <li><strong>Zone 3</strong>: Midpoint twist. Something new happens (maybe your moving platforms?).</li>
            <li><strong>Zone 4</strong>: Peak difficulty. The hardest challenge.</li>
            <li><strong>Zone 5</strong>: Resolution. Hard but satisfying, brings ideas together.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is classic game design structure. Players understand it intuitively. Zone 4 is where they sweat. Zone 5 is where they triumph.</p>

        <div class="try-it-box">
            <h3>Try It: Map Your Difficulty Curve</h3>
            <p>On paper, draw a line graph. X-axis is zones 1-5. Y-axis is difficulty (1-10). Plot where you think each zone currently sits. Zone 1 should be around 3-4. Zone 2 around 5-6. Zone 3 around 6-7. Zone 4 should peak at 8-9. Zone 5 should be 7-8 (slightly easier than 4). Does your graph show this curve? If not, adjust your plan.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Building Zone 4: The Gauntlet</h2>
        <p>Zone 4 is your hardest zone. It should combine multiple challenge types from previous zones and add new complexity.</p>

        <h3>Design Philosophy for Zone 4</h3>
        <p>Don't just make it "harder" by making jumps impossible. Make it harder by making it complex—multiple things happening at once, longer sequences without breaks, tighter timing windows.</p>

        <h3>Recommended Pattern: The Combination Zone</h3>
        <p>Build Zone 4 using elements from all previous zones:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Opening</strong>: Start with a familiar pattern (like Zone 1's simple jumps) but faster/tighter</li>
            <li><strong>Section 2</strong>: Add moving platforms (from Zone 3) in a harder configuration</li>
            <li><strong>Section 3</strong>: Mix vertical and horizontal movement</li>
            <li><strong>Section 4</strong>: Create a final test that requires precision</li>
            <li><strong>Checkpoint</strong>: Place at the end as a huge relief moment</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Specific Build Example: The Ascending Spiral with Moving Obstacles</h3>

        <p>Here's a complete Zone 4 build you can follow or adapt:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Base platform</strong>: Large landing area (10x10 studs)</li>
            <li><strong>Phase 1 - Speed test</strong>: Build 6 platforms in a line, gaps of 6.5 studs, forces quick jumping</li>
            <li><strong>Phase 2 - Moving platforms</strong>: Add 4 moving platforms that go vertical (up/down), stagger their timing</li>
            <li><strong>Rest platform</strong>: Medium safe platform for catching breath</li>
            <li><strong>Phase 3 - Spiral climb</strong>: Build a spiral (like Zone 3) but with smaller platforms (5x5 instead of 6x6)</li>
            <li><strong>Phase 4 - Final jump</strong>: Single hard jump to final platform (7 studs gap)</li>
            <li><strong>Checkpoint platform</strong>: Large platform (12x12) with checkpoint part</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This design combines speed, timing (moving platforms), 3D navigation (spiral), and a climactic final jump. It uses everything players learned but at higher difficulty.</p>

        <div class="tips-box">
            <h3>Zone 4 Design Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Length</strong>: Zone 4 should be longer than previous zones (60-90 seconds when played perfectly)</li>
                <li><strong>Checkpoints</strong>: Consider adding TWO checkpoints—one at the midpoint, one at the end. Long hard zones need midpoint saves.</li>
                <li><strong>Visual drama</strong>: Make it look intimidating. Use darker colors, bigger structures, more complex geometry.</li>
                <li><strong>Fair difficulty</strong>: Hard doesn't mean impossible. Everything should be achievable with practice.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Building Zone 5: The Victory Lap</h2>
        <p>Zone 5 is special. It's the ending. Players who reach it should feel accomplished, and the zone should deliver a satisfying conclusion.</p>

        <h3>Design Philosophy for Zone 5</h3>
        <p>Zone 5 should be hard—players earned the right to be challenged. But it shouldn't be harder than Zone 4. Think of it as "Zone 4's difficulty but more fun" or "a celebration of everything you built."</p>

        <h3>Recommended Pattern: The Greatest Hits</h3>
        <p>Build Zone 5 as a showcase of your best obstacles from Zones 1-4, remixed in new ways:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Take your favorite obstacle from Zone 1—rebuild it here but elevated</li>
            <li>Take the coolest part of Zone 2—include a variation</li>
            <li>Use moving platforms again, but in a new pattern</li>
            <li>Add one final unique element—something you didn't do in Zones 1-4</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Specific Build Example: The Grand Finale Path</h3>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Entrance</strong>: Grand archway or structure signaling "this is the end"</li>
            <li><strong>Section 1</strong>: Recreate your best static obstacle sequence from earlier zones</li>
            <li><strong>Section 2</strong>: Moving platforms that create a rhythm challenge</li>
            <li><strong>Section 3</strong>: A choice path (callback to Zone 3 if you built one, or new)</li>
            <li><strong>Section 4</strong>: Final approach—a dramatic, climactic sequence (spiral to a peak, long jump sequence, etc.)</li>
            <li><strong>Victory platform</strong>: Massive final platform with checkpoint and maybe decorative elements (trophies, sparkles, whatever feels victorious)</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="try-it-box">
            <h3>Try It: The Finale Element</h3>
            <p>Add one thing to Zone 5 you haven't done yet. Maybe it's rotating platforms. Maybe it's a color-changing platform sequence. Maybe it's platforms that grow and shrink. Use TweenService to animate something new. This makes Zone 5 memorable.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Maintaining Variety Across All Zones</h2>
        <p>With five zones built, check for variety. Run through your entire game and ask:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Does each zone feel different?</li>
            <li>Are you using different colors/materials for each zone?</li>
            <li>Do obstacles repeat too much, or is there good variation?</li>
            <li>Can you describe each zone with a unique phrase? ("The spiral zone," "The moving platform zone," etc.)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If two zones feel too similar, revise one. Similarity breeds boredom.</p>

        <h2>Difficulty Calibration Across All Zones</h2>
        <p>Now that all five zones exist, playtest the ENTIRE game in one sitting. From spawn to Zone 5 checkpoint. Track this data:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Total completion time</strong>: Should be 4-7 minutes for a skilled player</li>
            <li><strong>Death count per zone</strong>: Zone 1 (0-3 deaths), Zone 2 (3-6), Zone 3 (5-10), Zone 4 (10-15), Zone 5 (8-12)</li>
            <li><strong>Frustration points</strong>: Any obstacle that kills you 5+ times is too hard—revise it</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If your death counts are way higher, your game is too hard. Lower gaps, add safe platforms, or slow down moving platforms. If death counts are way lower, your game might be too easy. Increase challenge.</p>

        <div class="tips-box">
            <h3>The 10-Minute Rule</h3>
            <p>A complete run of your game (spawn to final checkpoint) should take 10-15 minutes for a new player, 4-7 minutes for a skilled player. If it's taking 30+ minutes, it's too long or too hard. Edit.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Visual Progression</h2>
        <p>Your zones should show visual progression. Here's a proven color/style progression:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Zone 1</strong>: Bright, simple colors (blues, greens) - feels safe and friendly</li>
            <li><strong>Zone 2</strong>: Slightly darker or more saturated colors - feels more serious</li>
            <li><strong>Zone 3</strong>: New color family (oranges, purples) - signals midpoint</li>
            <li><strong>Zone 4</strong>: Dark, intense colors (reds, blacks) - feels dangerous</li>
            <li><strong>Zone 5</strong>: Bright again, but different (golds, whites, neon) - feels triumphant</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This creates an emotional journey through color alone. Players feel the progression even if they're not consciously noticing it.</p>

        <h2>Adding Polish to Zones 4-5</h2>
        <p>Since these are your final zones, add extra polish:</p>

        <h3>Decorative Elements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Add non-functional parts that look cool (pillars, arches, floating shapes)</li>
            <li>Use a variety of part shapes (not just rectangular blocks)</li>
            <li>Add small details (small spheres, wedges, cylinders as accents)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Size and Scale</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Make Zone 4 feel big and imposing (larger structures, taller obstacles)</li>
            <li>Make Zone 5 feel grand and expansive (wide platforms, open space)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Scripting Polish</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure all moving platforms in Zones 4-5 have smooth, predictable motion</li>
            <li>Test all checkpoints to ensure they save progress correctly</li>
            <li>Verify all kill bricks kill instantly (CanCollide = false, script working)</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="try-it-box">
            <h3>Try It: The Victory Moment</h3>
            <p>At the end of Zone 5, after the checkpoint, add a finish zone trigger (like you built in Star 4). When players touch it, fire a message: "You completed the Island Runner! Great job!" This gives closure.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Common Mistakes in Final Zones</h2>

        <h3>Mistake 1: Difficulty Spike in Zone 5</h3>
        <p>Making Zone 5 harder than Zone 4 frustrates players. They expect the hardest challenge earlier, not at the very end. Keep Zone 5 challenging but slightly easier than Zone 4.</p>

        <h3>Mistake 2: Repetitive Design</h3>
        <p>Zones 4-5 that feel identical to earlier zones. Always ask: "What makes THIS zone special?" If you can't answer, redesign.</p>

        <h3>Mistake 3: Exhausting Length</h3>
        <p>Making Zones 4-5 too long. Players are tired by this point. Long zones need midpoint checkpoints or shorter obstacle sequences.</p>

        <h3>Mistake 4: Anticlimax</h3>
        <p>Zone 5 ending abruptly with no celebration. Add a victory platform, a message, something that says "You did it!" Endings matter.</p>

        <h2>Final Playtesting</h2>
        <p>With all five zones complete, do a comprehensive playtest:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Full run</strong>: Complete the game from spawn to Zone 5 end. No skipping.</li>
            <li><strong>Checkpoint test</strong>: Die intentionally in each zone, verify you respawn at correct checkpoints.</li>
            <li><strong>Difficulty check</strong>: Does difficulty increase smoothly from Zone 1 to 4, then slightly decrease in 5?</li>
            <li><strong>Visual check</strong>: Does each zone look distinct from the others?</li>
            <li><strong>Fun check</strong>: Are you having fun? If you're bored or frustrated with your own game, players will be too.</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="tips-box">
            <h3>The Fresh Eyes Test</h3>
            <p>If possible, have someone else play your complete game. Don't give instructions—just watch. Where do they get stuck? Where do they struggle? Where do they smile? Their experience reveals what you can't see anymore because you've tested it too much.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Checkpoint Placement Strategy</h2>
        <p>Review checkpoint placement across all zones:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Zone 1</strong>: One checkpoint at the end</li>
            <li><strong>Zone 2</strong>: One checkpoint at the end</li>
            <li><strong>Zone 3</strong>: One checkpoint at the end (or two if it's very long)</li>
            <li><strong>Zone 4</strong>: Two checkpoints (midpoint and end) - it's the hardest</li>
            <li><strong>Zone 5</strong>: One or two checkpoints depending on length</li>
        </ul>

        <p>More checkpoints = easier. Fewer = harder. Balance this based on your difficulty goals.</p>

        <h2>Preparing for the Next Star</h2>
        <p>Once Zones 4-5 are built, you're done with world building. Next up: flow testing (Mission 5.5), where you'll refine the entire experience. After that, Star 6 covers polish—lighting, skyboxes, and final details.</p>

        <p>Your game is nearly complete. These final two zones are the foundation of that completion. Build them with care.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mission-check">
        <h2>Mission Check</h2>
        <p>Before proceeding, verify:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Zone 4 is built and is the hardest zone in your game</li>
            <li>Zone 5 is built and provides a satisfying conclusion</li>
            <li>Both zones have checkpoints placed appropriately</li>
            <li>All five zones have distinct visual identities</li>
            <li>Difficulty progression follows the curve (1-2-3-4-5 with 4 as peak)</li>
            <li>You can complete all five zones in sequence</li>
            <li>Total game completion time is reasonable (4-15 minutes depending on skill)</li>
            <li>All moving platforms, kill bricks, and checkpoints work correctly</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="mission-bridge">
        <h2>What's Next</h2>
        <p>Five zones. Complete. Now comes the critical phase: flow testing. You'll play through your entire game multiple times, adjusting difficulty curves, fixing frustration points, and ensuring the experience flows smoothly from start to finish. This is where good games become great games.</p>
