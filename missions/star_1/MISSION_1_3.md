# Mission 1.3: Add Danger

**Learning Objective**: Create a kill brick using a simple script that sends players back to the start when touched

## Summary
Obstacle courses need danger! In this mission, you will create your first "kill brick" - a part that resets players when they touch it. You will write your very first Lua script and experience the thrill of making something interactive. This is where your project stops being just shapes and becomes a real game.

## Key Concepts
- Scripts contain code that makes things happen in your game
- Lua is the programming language used in Roblox
- The Touched event fires when a player contacts a part
- Humanoid:TakeDamage() can eliminate a player
- Kill bricks add challenge and consequence to obstacle courses

## Prerequisites
- Completed Mission 1.2 (have a jumping course built)
- Basic familiarity with the Roblox Studio interface
