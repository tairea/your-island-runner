            <p class="hook-opener">
                An empty baseplate is just potential. A baseplate with obstacles is a game. In the next 20 minutes, you are going to transform that flat gray surface into your first playable obstacle course - and you are going to do it by placing just four simple blocks.
            </p>

            <p>
                Every great Roblox obstacle course - or "obby" as players call them - is built from the same basic element: <strong>Parts</strong>. Parts are 3D shapes that you can move, resize, color, and arrange into anything you can imagine. Today, you will place your first four parts and create something you can actually play.
            </p>

            <div class="callout callout-motivation">
                <p><strong>Did You Know?</strong> The most popular obstacle course games on Roblox have been played billions of times. They all started with someone placing their first part - just like you are about to do right now.</p>

            <div class="objective-box">
                <p><strong>Learning Objective:</strong> Place 4 parts in Roblox Studio to create a playable jumping sequence that challenges players to reach the end.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>What You Will Build</h3>
            <p>A simple jumping course with:</p>
            <ul class="objective-checklist">
                <li>A starting platform (raised off the ground)</li>
                <li>Three jumping platforms that get progressively further apart</li>

            <div class="step-block">
                <h3>Step 1: Insert Your First Part</h3>

                <p>Make sure you are in edit mode (not playing). Let us add your first building block!</p>

                <ol class="instruction-list">
                    <li>Look at the top of the screen and click the <strong>Model</strong> tab</li>
                    <li>In the toolbar, find the <strong>Part</strong> button (it shows a small cube icon)</li>
                    <li>Click the small arrow next to "Part" to see different shapes</li>
                    <li>Select <strong>Block</strong> (the default rectangular shape)</li>
                </ol>

                <p>A gray block appears in your world! This is a <strong>Part</strong> - the most fundamental building element in Roblox.</p>

                <div class="callout callout-tip">
                    <p><strong>Keyboard Shortcut:</strong> You can also press <strong>Ctrl + 1</strong> (Windows) or <strong>Cmd + 1</strong> (Mac) to quickly insert a part. Speed matters when you are building!</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Step 2: Select and Move -->
            <div class="step-block">
                <h3>Step 2: Select and Move the Part</h3>

                <p>Your part appeared somewhere in the world, but probably not where you want it. Let us move it!</p>

                <ol class="instruction-list">
                    <li>Click on your part to <strong>select</strong> it (you will see a selection box around it)</li>
                    <li>In the <strong>Model</strong> tab, find and click the <strong>Move</strong> tool (or press <strong>Ctrl + 2</strong>)</li>
                    <li>You will see colored arrows appear on the part:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Red arrow</strong> = X axis (left/right)</li>
                            <li><strong>Green arrow</strong> = Y axis (up/down)</li>
                            <li><strong>Blue arrow</strong> = Z axis (forward/back)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Click and drag the <strong>green arrow</strong> to lift the part up</li>
                    <li>Position it about 5-6 studs above the baseplate</li>
                </ol>

                <div class="callout callout-info">
                    <p><strong>What is a Stud?</strong> A stud is Roblox's unit of measurement. The default part is 4x1x2 studs. A player character is about 5 studs tall and can jump approximately 7 studs high.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="try-it-box">
                    <h4>Try It!</h4>
                    <p>Press Play and try to jump onto your platform. Can you reach it? If it is too high (more than about 7 studs above the ground), go back and lower it. If it is too low (touching the ground), raise it up!</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Step 3: Resize the Starting Platform -->
            <div class="step-block">
                <h3>Step 3: Make It a Real Platform</h3>

                <p>The default part is pretty small. Let us make it bigger so it feels like a proper starting platform.</p>

                <ol class="instruction-list">
                    <li>Select your part</li>
                    <li>Click the <strong>Scale</strong> tool in the Model tab (or press <strong>Ctrl + 4</strong>)</li>
                    <li>You will see colored spheres on the corners and edges</li>
                    <li>Drag the spheres to resize:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Make the platform about <strong>8 studs wide</strong></li>
                            <li>Keep it <strong>2-4 studs tall</strong></li>
                            <li>Make it about <strong>8 studs deep</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>Now you have a proper starting platform that players can stand on comfortably!</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Step 4: Add More Platforms -->
            <div class="step-block">
                <h3>Step 4: Add Three More Platforms</h3>

                <p>Now for the fun part - building the jumping sequence!</p>

                <ol class="instruction-list">
                    <li>With your first platform selected, press <strong>Ctrl + D</strong> (Duplicate)</li>
                    <li>A copy appears! Use the Move tool to position it:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Move it <strong>forward</strong> (blue arrow) away from the first platform</li>
                            <li>Keep it at roughly the <strong>same height</strong></li>
                            <li>Position it about <strong>5-6 studs away</strong> - an easy first jump</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Duplicate again (<strong>Ctrl + D</strong>) to create a third platform</li>
                    <li>Move this one <strong>slightly further</strong> - about 7 studs from the second</li>
                    <li>Duplicate once more for your fourth and final platform</li>
                    <li>Position it at the <strong>maximum jump distance</strong> - about 8-9 studs away</li>
                </ol>

                <div class="callout callout-warning">
                    <p><strong>Jump Distance Rule:</strong> Players can jump forward about 8-10 studs maximum when running at full speed. If your platforms are further apart than that, the jump becomes impossible! When in doubt, make jumps slightly easier than you think.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Step 5: Add Variety -->
            <div class="step-block">
                <h3>Step 5: Add Some Variety (Optional Challenge)</h3>

                <p>Want to make it more interesting? Try these variations:</p>

                <ul class="instruction-list">
                    <li><strong>Height changes:</strong> Make platform 3 slightly higher than platform 2</li>
                    <li><strong>Size changes:</strong> Make the later platforms smaller (harder to land on)</li>
                    <li><strong>Angles:</strong> Position platforms in a zig-zag instead of a straight line</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="callout callout-tip">
                    <p><strong>Design Tip:</strong> Good obstacle courses start easy and get harder. Your first jump should be almost automatic, and each one after should require a bit more skill. This teaches players and builds confidence!</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Step 6: Test Your Course -->
            <div class="step-block">
                <h3>Step 6: Test Everything!</h3>

                <p>The only way to know if your course works is to play it yourself.</p>

                <ol class="instruction-list">
                    <li>Click <strong>Play</strong></li>
                    <li>Walk to your starting platform and jump up onto it</li>
                    <li>Try to complete all three jumps</li>
                    <li>If any jump is impossible, click <strong>Stop</strong> and adjust the platform positions</li>
                    <li>Repeat until you can complete the course!</li>
                </ol>

                <div class="try-it-box">
                    <h4>Try It!</h4>
                    <p>Complete your course three times in a row. If you fail on the same jump multiple times, it might be too hard. If you never fail, consider making it slightly more challenging!</p>
