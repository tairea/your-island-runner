            <p class="hook-opener">
                What separates a playground from a game? <strong>Consequences.</strong> Right now, your jumping course is just practice - miss a jump and nothing happens. But in a real game, missing a jump should matter. In this mission, you are going to write your first lines of code and create something that makes players think twice before they leap.
            </p>

            <p>
                You are about to become a programmer. Not just someone who places blocks, but someone who makes those blocks <em>do things</em>. By the end of this mission, your game will have a deadly kill brick that resets players who touch it. One small script, one huge leap forward.

                <p><strong>Programming is Power:</strong> Every video game you have ever played runs on code. Code makes enemies chase you, coins disappear when collected, and checkpoints save your progress. Today, you join the ranks of people who write that code.</p>

            <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

            <!-- Step 1: Create the Kill Brick -->
            <div class="step-block">
                <h3>Step 1: Create the Danger Zone</h3>

                <p>First, we need a part that represents danger. Let us create a big red zone below your jumping course.</p>

                <ol class="instruction-list">
                    <li>Go to the <strong>Model</strong> tab and insert a new <strong>Part</strong> (Block)</li>
                    <li>Use the <strong>Scale</strong> tool to make it large - about 50x1x50 studs</li>
                    <li>Use the <strong>Move</strong> tool to position it directly below your platforms, about 10 studs down</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Now let us make it look dangerous:</p>

                <ol class="instruction-list" start="4">
                    <li>With the part selected, look at the <strong>Properties</strong> panel on the right side of the screen</li>
                    <li>If you do not see Properties, go to <strong>View</strong> tab and click <strong>Properties</strong></li>
                    <li>Find the <strong>BrickColor</strong> property and click on it</li>
                    <li>Select <strong>Bright red</strong> or <strong>Really red</strong></li>
                    <li>Find the <strong>Name</strong> property at the top and change it from "Part" to <strong>KillBrick</strong></li>
                </ol>

                <div class="callout callout-tip">
                    <p><strong>Naming Matters:</strong> Always give your parts descriptive names! When you have hundreds of parts, you will thank yourself for naming them clearly. "KillBrick" is much easier to find than "Part" or "Part47".</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Step 2: Add a Script -->
            <div class="step-block">
                <h3>Step 2: Add a Script to Your Kill Brick</h3>

                <p>Parts just sit there until you add code. Let us give your kill brick a brain!</p>

                <ol class="instruction-list">
                    <li>In the <strong>Explorer</strong> panel (usually on the right), find your <strong>KillBrick</strong></li>
                    <li>Right-click on <strong>KillBrick</strong></li>
                    <li>Hover over <strong>Insert Object</strong></li>
                    <li>Click <strong>Script</strong></li>
                </ol>

                <p>A new Script appears inside your KillBrick, and a code editor opens! You will see some default text:</p>

                <div class="code-block">
                    <pre>print("Hello world!")</pre>
                </div>

                <p>This default code just prints a message. We are going to replace it with our kill brick code.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Step 3: Write the Code -->
            <div class="step-block">
                <h3>Step 3: Write Your First Real Code</h3>

                <p>Delete everything in the script and type this code exactly:</p>

                <div class="code-block">
                    <pre>local killBrick = script.Parent

local function onTouched(otherPart)
    local humanoid = otherPart.Parent:FindFirstChild("Humanoid")
    if humanoid then
        humanoid.Health = 0
    end
end

killBrick.Touched:Connect(onTouched)</pre>
                </div>

                <div class="callout callout-warning">
                    <p><strong>Type Carefully!</strong> Code must be typed exactly right. Every capital letter, every period, every parenthesis matters. If something does not work, check your spelling and punctuation first!</p>
                </div>

                <h4>What Does This Code Do?</h4>

                <p>Let us break it down line by line:</p>

                <div class="code-explanation">
                    <div class="code-line">
                        <code>local killBrick = script.Parent</code>
                        <p>This stores a reference to the part containing this script (your KillBrick).</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="code-line">
                        <code>local function onTouched(otherPart)</code>
                        <p>This creates a function named "onTouched" that runs whenever something touches our brick. The "otherPart" is whatever touched us.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="code-line">
                        <code>local humanoid = otherPart.Parent:FindFirstChild("Humanoid")</code>
                        <p>This checks if the thing that touched us is part of a player character. Players have a "Humanoid" component that controls their health and movement.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="code-line">
                        <code>if humanoid then</code>
                        <p>This checks: "Did we actually find a Humanoid?" We only want to kill players, not random parts.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="code-line">
                        <code>humanoid.Health = 0</code>
                        <p>This sets the player's health to zero, which eliminates them!</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="code-line">
                        <code>killBrick.Touched:Connect(onTouched)</code>
                        <p>This connects our function to the brick's Touched event. Now, whenever anything touches the brick, our onTouched function runs.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Step 4: Test It -->
            <div class="step-block">
                <h3>Step 4: Test Your Kill Brick</h3>

                <p>Time to see if your code works!</p>

                <ol class="instruction-list">
                    <li>Click <strong>Play</strong></li>
                    <li>Walk off the edge of the baseplate and fall onto your red kill brick</li>
                    <li>Watch what happens!</li>
                </ol>

                <p>If everything worked, you should see your character disappear and respawn at the starting position. Congratulations - your first script works!</p>

                <div class="try-it-box">
                    <h4>Try It!</h4>
                    <p>Jump off from different heights. Try landing on the edge of the kill brick. Does it work every time? Try missing a platform jump and falling - does the kill brick catch you?</p>
                </div>

                <ul class="instruction-list">
                    <li>It should be <strong>below all your platforms</strong> so missing any jump is deadly</li>

                    <li>Consider adding walls around the edges so players cannot escape sideways</li>
