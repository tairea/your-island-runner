# Mission 1.4: Victory Part

**Learning Objective**: Add a distinctively colored finish line part that marks the completion point of your obstacle course

## Summary
Every game needs a goal! In this mission, you will create a victory zone at the end of your course. You will learn how to change the color of parts to make them stand out, creating a clear visual target that tells players "reach here to win!" This transforms your jumping platforms into a complete game with a beginning, middle, and end.

## Key Concepts

- Visual distinction helps players understand game goals
- A finish line creates a sense of accomplishment
- Good game design communicates objectives clearly
