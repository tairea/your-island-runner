            <h1>Mission 1.1: Instant Setup</h1>

            <p class="hook-opener">
                Right now, millions of people are playing games that started exactly where you are about to start: with a blank screen and an idea. Roblox has over 70 million daily players, and every single game they play was built by someone using the same free tool you are about to download. Today, you join the ranks of Roblox developers.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the next 15 minutes, you will go from having nothing to pressing Play on your very first Roblox project. No experience required. No tricks. Just follow along, and by the end of this mission, you will have a working game environment running on your screen.
            </p>

            <div class="callout callout-motivation">
                <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Some of the most popular Roblox games earn their creators millions of dollars per year. Every one of those developers started exactly like you - opening Roblox Studio for the first time and wondering what to click.</p>

                <p>If you already have a Roblox account, skip to Step 2. Otherwise, let us get you set up.</p>

                <ol class="instruction-list">
                    <li>Open your web browser and go to <strong>roblox.com</strong></li>

            </div>

            <!-- Step 2: Download Studio -->
            <div class="step-block">
                <h3>Step 2: Download Roblox Studio</h3>

                <p>Roblox Studio is completely free. It is the official tool that all Roblox games are made with.</p>

                <ol class="instruction-list">
                    <li>Go to <strong>roblox.com/create</strong></li>
                    <li>Click <strong>Start Creating</strong></li>

                    <li>Run the installer file that downloads</li>
                    <li>Wait for the installation to complete (this may take a few minutes)</li>
                </ol>

                <div class="callout callout-info">
                    <p><strong>Note for School Computers:</strong> If you get a message saying you cannot install software, raise your hand and let your teacher know. They may need to help you or contact IT.</p>

            <!-- Step 3: Open Studio -->
            <div class="step-block">
                <h3>Step 3: Open Roblox Studio</h3>

                <p>Once installation finishes, Roblox Studio should open automatically. If it does not:</p>

                <ul class="instruction-list">
                    <li><strong>Windows:</strong> Search for "Roblox Studio" in the Start menu</li>
                    <li><strong>Mac:</strong> Find "Roblox Studio" in your Applications folder</li>
                </ul>

                <p>When Studio opens, you will see a home screen with templates and recent projects. This is your launching pad for creating games!</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Step 4: Create Baseplate -->
            <div class="step-block">
                <h3>Step 4: Create a New Baseplate Project</h3>

                <p>A <strong>Baseplate</strong> is the simplest possible Roblox world - just a flat ground and a place for players to spawn. It is perfect for learning.</p>

                <ol class="instruction-list">
                    <li>On the home screen, look for the <strong>New</strong> tab or section</li>
                    <li>Find the template called <strong>Baseplate</strong> (it looks like a gray flat surface)</li>
                    <li>Click on <strong>Baseplate</strong> to create a new project</li>
                    <li>Wait a moment while your project loads</li>
                </ol>

                <p>When it loads, you will see a 3D view of a large gray floor stretching into the distance. Congratulations - you are looking at your first game world!</p>

                <div class="callout callout-explore">
                    <p><strong>Explore:</strong> Try clicking and dragging in the 3D view. Hold the right mouse button and move your mouse to look around. Use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out. Get comfortable with moving your view - you will do this constantly!</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Step 5: Find Play/Stop -->
            <div class="step-block">
                <h3>Step 5: Find the Play and Stop Buttons</h3>

                <p>The most important buttons in Roblox Studio are <strong>Play</strong> and <strong>Stop</strong>. They let you instantly test your game.</p>

                <ol class="instruction-list">
                    <li>Look at the top of the screen for the <strong>Home</strong> tab (it should already be selected)</li>
                    <li>In the toolbar, find the <strong>Play</strong> button - it is a blue button with a play triangle</li>
                    <li>The <strong>Stop</strong> button is right next to it - it is a red square</li>
                </ol>

                <div class="visual-guide">
                    <p><strong>Visual Guide:</strong> The Play button is in the "Test" section of the Home tab toolbar. It looks like this: a blue circle with a white triangle pointing right (like a video play button).</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Step 6: Test It -->
            <div class="step-block">
                <h3>Step 6: Play Your First Game!</h3>

                <p>Time for the magic moment. Let us run your game!</p>

                <ol class="instruction-list">
                    <li>Click the <strong>Play</strong> button</li>
                    <li>Watch as the view changes - you are now a player in your game!</li>
                    <li>Use <strong>W, A, S, D</strong> to walk around</li>
                    <li>Press <strong>Space</strong> to jump</li>
                    <li>Move your mouse to look around</li>
                    <li>When you are done exploring, click the <strong>Stop</strong> button to return to editing</li>
                </ol>

                <div class="try-it-box">
                    <h4>Try It!</h4>
                    <p>Walk to the edge of the baseplate and jump off. What happens? (Do not worry, nothing breaks - this is how you discover how Roblox works!)</p>
                </div>

                <div class="callout callout-important">
                    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Always click <strong>Stop</strong> before trying to build or change anything. If you try to edit while the game is running, your changes might not save properly!</p>
