            <p class="hook-opener">
                You are no longer just a student learning software. You are a game developer with a finished game. In the next 15 minutes, you are going to experience your creation as a player, look at it with fresh eyes, and then do something that takes real courage: show it to other people.
            </p>

            <p>
                Every professional game developer goes through this moment - the transition from building to playing, from creator to critic, from private project to public showcase. Some of the most valuable lessons come not from building, but from watching others play what you built. Today, you join that tradition.
            </p>

            <div class="callout callout-motivation">
                <p><strong>Real Talk:</strong> Sharing your work can feel scary. What if someone does not like it? What if they find a bug? Here is the truth: every game has bugs at first, and feedback is how games get better. The developers of your favorite games went through this exact process hundreds of times. You are in good company.</p>

                <p>It is time to play your game like you have never seen it before. Try to forget that you built it.</p>

                <ol class="instruction-list">

                    <li>Complete the course <strong>at least 3 times</strong></li>

                <div class="callout callout-tip">
                    <p><strong>Playtester Mindset:</strong> While playing, ask yourself: Is this fun? Is it too easy? Too hard? Does anything feel unfair? Would a new player understand what to do? These questions are what professional playtesters ask.</p>

                <h3>Step 4: Understand the Iteration Loop</h3>

                <p>What you just did has a name in game development: <strong>iteration</strong>. It is the most important process in making games:</p>

                <div class="process-diagram">
                    <div class="process-step">
                        <span class="step-number">1</span>

                        <p>Create something</p>
                    </div>

                        <span class="step-number">2</span>
                        <span class="step-name">Test</span>
                        <p>Play it yourself</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="process-arrow">→</div>
                    <div class="process-step">
                        <span class="step-number">3</span>
                        <span class="step-name">Observe</span>
                        <p>Notice what works and what does not</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="process-arrow">→</div>
                    <div class="process-step">
                        <span class="step-number">4</span>
                        <span class="step-name">Improve</span>
                        <p>Make changes</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="process-arrow">→</div>
                    <div class="process-step">
                        <span class="step-number">5</span>
                        <span class="step-name">Repeat</span>
                        <p>Go back to step 2</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>This loop never really ends. Even published games get updates and patches. The best game developers are the ones who are always willing to iterate and improve.</p>

                <ol class="instruction-list">

                    <li>When your teacher calls on you, <strong>share your screen</strong></li>

                <div class="callout callout-tip">
                    <p><strong>Presentation Tip:</strong> When sharing, give a quick intro: "This is my obstacle course. The goal is to jump across the platforms to reach the green finish line. The red floor is a kill brick - touch it and you restart!" Then play through your course.</p>

            <p>In <strong>Star 2: Island Vision</strong>, you will research your local area using satellite imagery from Google Maps. You will trace the shape of your island or town, identify real landmarks, and plan an obstacle course that tells the story of YOUR place. By the end of this course, you will have a game that represents where you live!</p>
