# Mission 1.2: Three-Jump Course

**Learning Objective**: Place 4 parts in Roblox Studio to create a playable jumping sequence that challenges players to reach the end

## Summary
Time to build something playable! In this mission, you will insert parts (3D blocks) into your game world and position them to create three jumps. You will learn how to add new parts, move them around, and test whether your jumps are actually possible. This is the core skill of building obstacle courses in Roblox.

## Key Concepts
- Parts are the basic 3D building blocks in Roblox
- The Model tab contains the Part button for inserting new parts
- The Move tool lets you drag parts to new positions
- Jump height in Roblox is approximately 7 studs (the unit of measurement)
- You must test your jumps to make sure they are possible

## Prerequisites
- Completed Mission 1.1 (Roblox Studio installed and baseplate open)
- Know how to press Play and Stop
