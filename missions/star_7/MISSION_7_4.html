            <h2>The Victory Lap</h2>
            <p>
                You started this journey with an idea and an empty world. Over seven stars and dozens of
                missions, you learned to shape terrain, design challenges, implement mechanics, polish
                experiences, and publish to a platform used by millions. The game you're about to present
                is proof of what you can create when you combine learning with persistence.
            </p>
            <p>
                This final mission isn't about building—it's about sharing and reflecting. You'll present
                your island runner to your class, not just as a project, but as a story of creative and
                technical problem-solving. You'll watch others experience what you built, receive their
                reactions, and reflect on your growth as a developer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Game developers call this moment "shipping"—releasing your work and seeing players engage
                with it. It's nerve-wracking and exciting. It's vulnerable and rewarding. And it's the moment
                that transforms you from someone learning game development into someone who has actually
                developed and shipped a game. Today, you celebrate that transformation.
            </p>
            <div class="mission-insight">
                <strong>The Developer's Journey:</strong> Every game developer remembers their first shipped
                project. It might not be perfect. It might be small compared to what they'll make later. But
                it's the one that proved to them—and the world—that they can create. Your island runner is
                that proof. Own it with pride.

            <h2>Mission Objective</h2>
            <p>
                Prepare and deliver a 3-5 minute presentation about your island runner, share your game link
                for classmates to play, demonstrate a walkthrough of your course, reflect on your development
                journey, and celebrate the completion of your first published Roblox game.

            <h2>Part 1: Preparing Your Presentation</h2>

            <h3>What Makes a Great Game Showcase</h3>
            <p>
                Your presentation should accomplish three things: show what you made, explain why you made
                the choices you did, and tell the story behind your island. Think of this as a combination
                of demo, design talk, and storytelling.
            </p>

            <div class="presentation-structure">
                <h4>Recommended Presentation Outline (3-5 minutes)</h4>

                <p><strong>1. The Hook (30 seconds)</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start with your island's name and theme</li>
                    <li>One sentence that captures what your game is about</li>
                    <li>Example: "I created Volcano Island Runner, where you race across an erupting volcano
                    to reach the rescue helicopter before the island explodes."</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>2. The Story (30-45 seconds)</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Share your island's backstory or concept</li>
                    <li>Why did you choose this theme?</li>
                    <li>What atmosphere or feeling did you want players to experience?</li>
                    <li>Example: "I wanted to create a sense of urgency and danger, so I designed an island
                    that's falling apart. The lava rising behind you makes every jump matter."</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>3. The Demo (1-2 minutes)</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Screen share or play through the beginning of your course</li>
                    <li>Point out key obstacles and challenges</li>
                    <li>Highlight features you're proud of</li>
                    <li>Show, don't just tell—let them see the game in action</li>
                    <li>Example: "Here's the starting beach, then you jump to these floating rocks, this
                    section has the rotating obstacles I spent two missions perfecting..."</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>4. Design Highlights (45-60 seconds)</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Share 2-3 specific design or technical choices you made</li>
                    <li>Explain challenges you faced and how you solved them</li>
                    <li>Mention polish details (lighting, sound, visual effects)</li>
                    <li>Example: "The hardest part was balancing difficulty—I tested the jump distances
                    dozens of times. I also added glowing crystals to guide players toward the path."</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>5. The Invitation (15-30 seconds)</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Share your game link (display on screen or in chat)</li>
                    <li>Invite classmates to try it</li>
                    <li>Mention what feedback you'd value</li>
                    <li>Example: "The link is in the chat—I'd love to see how fast you can complete it,
                    and whether the difficulty feels fair!"</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Presentation Tips</h3>
            <div class="presentation-advice">
                <h4>Effective Delivery</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Practice your timing:</strong> Run through your presentation at least twice
                    to make sure you fit in 3-5 minutes</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't memorize word-for-word:</strong> Know your key points and speak naturally</li>
                    <li><strong>Show enthusiasm:</strong> Your excitement about your game is contagious</li>
                    <li><strong>Make eye contact:</strong> Look at your audience, not just the screen</li>
                    <li><strong>Slow down:</strong> Nerves make us rush—deliberately pace yourself</li>
                    <li><strong>Use "I" statements:</strong> "I designed..." "I chose..." "I learned..."
                    This is your work—own it!</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Handling Demo Technical Issues</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Have screenshots ready:</strong> If live demo fails, show images</li>
                    <li><strong>Pre-load your game:</strong> Have it open before you present</li>
                    <li><strong>Test screen sharing:</strong> Make sure it works ahead of time</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't panic:</strong> If something breaks, explain what should happen and
                    move on</li>
                    <li><strong>Humor helps:</strong> "Well, that's live demos for you!" then continue</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Visual Support (Optional but Recommended)</h3>
            <p>
                While not required, a simple slide or two can enhance your presentation and give the audience
                something to look at beyond the game itself.
            </p>

            <div class="visual-aids">
                <h4>Suggested Slides</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Title slide:</strong> Game name, your name, and your thumbnail image</li>
                    <li><strong>Design highlights:</strong> Bullet points of key features or challenges</li>
                    <li><strong>Link slide:</strong> Large, readable game URL and/or QR code</li>
                    <li><strong>Thank you slide:</strong> Simple ending with your name</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Keep slides minimal—big text, few words, striking images. The game itself is your main visual.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Part 2: The Live Demo</h2>

            <h3>Demonstrating Your Game Effectively</h3>
            <p>
                The live demo is where your game comes to life for your audience. This is more impactful
                than any description—they need to see it running.
            </p>

            <div class="demo-guide">
                <h4>Demo Best Practices</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Start from the beginning:</strong> Show the spawn experience so viewers understand
                    the complete player journey</li>
                    <li><strong>Narrate as you play:</strong> Explain what you're doing and why
                        <ul>
                            <li>"Now I'm jumping to this platform..."</li>
                            <li>"This part is tricky because..."</li>
                            <li>"I added this visual effect to show..."</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Point out polish:</strong> Highlight lighting, sounds, effects that viewers
                    might miss</li>
                    <li><strong>Show personality:</strong> Celebrate good jumps, react if you fall—be authentic</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't try to "perfect" it:</strong> If you die during the demo, that shows
                    the challenge is real</li>
                    <li><strong>Time-conscious:</strong> Don't play the entire game—show the first third,
                    then skip to interesting parts</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>What to Highlight During Demo</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your favorite obstacle or section</li>
                    <li>A mechanic you're proud of (moving platforms, collectibles, special jumps)</li>
                    <li>The visual theme and how different sections look</li>
                    <li>Any story elements or environmental storytelling</li>
                    <li>The win condition or ending</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Handling Q&A</h3>
            <p>
                Your classmates or teacher might ask questions after your presentation. This is a sign of
                engagement—embrace it!
            </p>

            <div class="qa-tips">
                <h4>Common Questions and How to Answer</h4>

                <p><strong>"How long did it take to make?"</strong></p>
                <p>Be honest about time—mention it was built across 7 stars over [X] weeks/days. You can
                note which parts took longest.</p>

                <p><strong>"What was the hardest part?"</strong></p>
                <p>Share a specific challenge you faced—maybe balancing difficulty, getting a mechanic to
                work, or making a design decision.</p>

                <p><strong>"Will you add more to it?"</strong></p>
                <p>You can discuss future ideas or say you're happy with it as is. Either answer is valid.</p>

                <p><strong>"How did you learn to do this?"</strong></p>
                <p>Mention the Galaxy Maps curriculum, specific missions that taught key skills, and any
                experimentation you did.</p>

                <p><strong>If you don't know an answer:</strong></p>
                <p>It's okay to say "That's a great question—I'm not sure, but I could look into it."
                Honesty is better than making something up.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Part 3: Playtime and Feedback</h2>

            <h3>Watching Others Play Your Game</h3>
            <p>
                One of the most rewarding (and sometimes nerve-wracking) experiences in game development is
                watching someone else play your creation. You'll learn more from observation than from any
                amount of testing yourself.
            </p>

            <div class="observation-guide">
                <h4>What to Observe</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Where do they pause or hesitate?</strong> This reveals unclear design or
                    confusing navigation</li>
                    <li><strong>Where do they laugh or react?</strong> These are your success moments—the
                    parts that work</li>
                    <li><strong>Do they go where you expected?</strong> Players often find creative paths or
                    shortcuts</li>
                    <li><strong>Where do they struggle?</strong> Note if it's because of skill or because
                    something is unclear</li>
                    <li><strong>Do they seem engaged?</strong> Are they focused and trying, or bored and
                    distracted?</li>
                    <li><strong>How long do they play?</strong> Do they finish, or give up partway?</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="observation-reminder">
                    <strong>Resist the urge to help:</strong> Let them figure things out on their own. If
                    they get stuck, that's valuable feedback about your game's clarity, not their skill. Only
                    help if they explicitly ask or if they're completely stuck beyond recovery.
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Receiving Feedback Gracefully</h3>
            <p>
                Your classmates will share their thoughts on your game. Some feedback will be praise, some
                will be suggestions, some might be criticism. All of it is valuable if you approach it with
                the right mindset.
            </p>

            <div class="feedback-mindset">
                <h4>The Professional Feedback Mindset</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Listen without defending:</strong> Don't immediately explain why you made a
                    choice—just hear them out</li>
                    <li><strong>Thank people for feedback:</strong> Even if you disagree, appreciate that they
                    took time to play and share thoughts</li>
                    <li><strong>Ask clarifying questions:</strong> "What specifically felt too hard?" is more
                    useful than just "too hard"</li>
                    <li><strong>Look for patterns:</strong> If three people mention the same issue, it's
                    probably real</li>
                    <li><strong>Separate yourself from your work:</strong> Criticism of your game isn't
                    criticism of you</li>
                    <li><strong>Remember what you've accomplished:</strong> You made and published a game—that's
                    huge, regardless of specific feedback</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Useful Feedback Questions to Ask</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>"What was your favorite part?"</li>
                    <li>"Was anything confusing or unclear?"</li>
                    <li>"Did the difficulty feel fair?"</li>
                    <li>"On a scale of 1-10, how fun was it?"</li>
                    <li>"Would you play more if there were additional levels?"</li>
                    <li>"Any suggestions for improvement?"</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Giving Feedback to Others</h3>
            <p>
                You'll also play your classmates' games and provide feedback. Be the kind of audience member
                you'd want for your own presentation.
            </p>

            <div class="giving-feedback">
                <h4>How to Give Helpful Feedback</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Start with positives:</strong> What did you genuinely enjoy or find impressive?</li>
                    <li><strong>Be specific:</strong> "The volcano theme was really cool" is better than "nice job"</li>
                    <li><strong>Frame suggestions constructively:</strong> "I'd love to see..." rather than
                    "You should have..."</li>
                    <li><strong>Consider their goals:</strong> Evaluate the game based on what they were trying
                    to achieve</li>
                    <li><strong>Balance praise and critique:</strong> Aim for 2 positives for every suggestion</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid comparisons:</strong> Don't say "X's game was better" or "This is like
                    Y but worse"</li>
                    <li><strong>Ask about intentions:</strong> "Were you going for a hard challenge or casual
                    fun?" before critiquing difficulty</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Looking Back at Seven Stars</h3>
            <p>
                You've completed an entire game development journey. Take time to reflect on how far you've
                come and what you've learned.

            <h3>The Developer Mindset</h3>
            <p>
                Beyond specific skills, you've developed something more important: the mindset of a creator.
                You've experienced the full cycle of taking an idea from concept to published reality.
            </p>

            <div class="developer-growth">
                <h4>What You've Actually Learned</h4>

                <p><strong>Star 1: Foundation</strong> - You learned to shape digital worlds from nothing</p>
                <p><strong>Star 2: Challenge Design</strong> - You understood how to create engaging obstacles</p>
                <p><strong>Star 3: Core Mechanics</strong> - You made interactive systems that respond to players</p>
                <p><strong>Star 4: Advanced Features</strong> - You added depth and variety to experiences</p>
                <p><strong>Star 5: Difficulty Balance</strong> - You learned to tune experiences for your audience</p>
                <p><strong>Star 6: Polish</strong> - You made things not just work, but feel good</p>
                <p><strong>Star 7: Launch</strong> - You shared your creation with the world</p>

                <p>
                    These aren't just Roblox skills—they're transferable to any creative or technical field.
                    Project planning, iterative design, problem-solving, debugging, user experience, presentation,
                    receiving feedback—these are professional competencies you've practiced in an authentic context.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2>Part 5: Celebration</h2>

            <h3>Acknowledging Your Achievement</h3>
            <p>
                Many people talk about making games. Many people start learning game development. Fewer
                people finish what they start. And even fewer people actually publish and share their work.
                You did all of that.
            </p>

            <div class="celebration-message">
                <h4>You Are Now:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>A published Roblox game developer</li>
                    <li>Someone who completed a multi-week project from start to finish</li>
                    <li>A creator who shipped work for real players to experience</li>
                    <li>A problem-solver who debugged, tested, and polished</li>
                    <li>A designer who made meaningful choices about player experience</li>
                    <li>A member of the global game development community</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Your island runner exists. It's online. It's playable. People can experience it. That's
                    not a school project—that's real creation. Whether 10 people play it or 10,000, you made
                    something real and shared it. That takes courage, skill, and commitment.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>What Comes Next?</h3>
            <p>
                This might be the end of your island runner project, but it doesn't have to be the end of
                your game development journey. You now have the foundation to keep creating.
            </p>

            <h3>The Final Message</h3>
            <div class="final-message">
                <p>
                    Game development is equal parts technical skill, creative vision, and persistent problem-solving.
                    Over the course of this project, you've practiced all three. You've built something where
                    nothing existed. You've solved problems you didn't know how to solve when you started.
                    You've made creative decisions about aesthetics, difficulty, and player experience. And
                    you've seen it through to completion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The skills you've learned extend far beyond Roblox. The ability to break complex problems
                    into manageable steps. The persistence to debug when things don't work. The creativity to
                    design engaging experiences. The communication to present your work effectively. These are
                    life skills, career skills, and maker skills that will serve you in any field you pursue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your island runner is the first game you published. It won't be the last thing you create.
                    You now know what's possible when you commit to learning and building. You've proven to
                    yourself that you can take an idea and make it real. That knowledge is powerful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Congratulations on completing your island runner. Congratulations on becoming a published
                    game developer. And congratulations on joining the community of creators who make the
                    digital worlds we all enjoy. You've earned this celebration.
                </p>

                developers now.</strong></p>
