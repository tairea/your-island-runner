            <h2>The Launch Moment</h2>
            <p>
                Every published game, from small student projects to massive AAA titles, has a launch day.
                Today is yours. You've designed, built, tested, polished, and prepared. You've turned an
                empty Roblox Studio workspace into a complete experience. Now it's time to share it.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's something special about clicking that publish button for the first time. It's a mix
                of excitement, nervousness, and pride. You're putting your creative work out into the world
                where real people will play it. That takes courage, and it's exactly what game developers do
                every time they launch something new.
            </p>
            <p>
                This mission is straightforward—you'll follow the publishing steps, upload your assets, and
                verify everything works. But take a moment to appreciate what you've accomplished. You didn't
                just follow a tutorial. You created something that exists, that others can experience, that's
                permanently part of the Roblox platform. That's real development.
            </p>
            <div class="mission-insight">
                <strong>Developer Moment:</strong> Many professional developers remember their first published
                game more vividly than later successes. That first launch—no matter how small the game—is a
                milestone that marks the transition from learning to creating. Today, you become a published
                game developer.

            <h2>Mission Objective</h2>
            <p>
                Publish your island runner game to the Roblox platform, upload your thumbnail and assets,
                set appropriate permissions, and verify that your game is live, accessible, and working
                correctly for players. You'll obtain and test your shareable link to ensure others can find
                and play your creation.

            <h2>Part 1: The Publishing Process</h2>

            <h3>Step 1: Final Studio Check</h3>
            <p>
                Before you publish, open your game one last time in Roblox Studio and do a quick verification.
            </p>

            <div class="final-check">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Save your work:</strong> Press Ctrl+S to ensure everything is saved</li>
                    <li><strong>Quick test:</strong> Press F5 and do a 30-second playthrough to confirm nothing broke</li>
                    <li><strong>Check Output:</strong> Look for any error messages in the Output window</li>
                    <li><strong>Verify assets:</strong> Make sure all your sounds, effects, and scripts are working</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    If anything seems off, fix it now. Once published, you can update, but it's better to
                    launch with everything working correctly.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Step 2: Publishing to Roblox</h3>
            <p>
                Now you're ready to push your game to the Roblox platform. The publishing process uploads
                your entire game to Roblox's servers where it can be accessed by players.
            </p>

            <div class="publishing-steps">
                <h4>Publishing Your Game</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Click "File" → "Publish to Roblox"</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If this is your first publish, it will say "Publish to Roblox"</li>
                            <li>If you've published before, it will say "Publish to Roblox As..."</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Choose publishing option:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Select "Create new game..." if this is your first time</li>
                            <li>Or select your existing game to update it</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Verify your settings:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Game name appears correctly</li>
                            <li>Description is complete</li>
                            <li>Genre is set appropriately</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Set initial visibility:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>For classroom launches, you might start with "Private" or "Friends Only"</li>
                            <li>This lets you test before opening to everyone</li>
                            <li>You can change to "Public" later</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Click "Create" or "Save"</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The upload process will begin—this may take 30 seconds to a few minutes</li>
                            <li>Don't close Studio during the upload</li>
                            <li>You'll see a progress indicator</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Wait for confirmation:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You'll get a message when publishing is complete</li>
                            <li>Studio will show "Saved to Roblox" in the title bar</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="publishing-tip">
                <strong>First Publish vs. Updates:</strong> Your first publish creates the game on Roblox's
                servers and gives it a unique Game ID. Future publishes are updates to that same game. Players
                who favorite your game will automatically get updates when you publish new versions.
            </div>

            <h3>Step 3: Uploading Your Thumbnail</h3>
            <p>
                Your thumbnail won't upload automatically with the game—you need to add it through the Roblox
                website. This is a crucial step because your game won't look appealing without it.
            </p>

            <div class="thumbnail-upload-guide">
                <h4>Adding Your Thumbnail</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Open your web browser</strong> and go to <a href="https://www.roblox.com">www.roblox.com</a></li>
                    <li><strong>Log in</strong> to your Roblox account (if not already logged in)</li>
                    <li><strong>Click "Create"</strong> in the top navigation bar</li>
                    <li><strong>Find your game</strong> in the list of creations
                        <ul>
                            <li>It should be at the top if you just published it</li>
                            <li>Look for the name you gave it</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Click on your game</strong> to open its management page</li>
                    <li><strong>Look for the "Icon" or "Thumbnails" section</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Click "Upload Image"</strong> or the add thumbnail button</li>
                    <li><strong>Select your thumbnail file</strong> from where you saved it</li>
                    <li><strong>Confirm the upload</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Roblox may take a few moments to process the image</li>
                            <li>Make sure it appears correctly and isn't cut off oddly</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Set as primary</strong> if you upload multiple thumbnails</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="thumbnail-guidelines">
                <h4>Thumbnail Upload Requirements</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>File size:</strong> Maximum 10MB (most screenshots are under 2MB)</li>
                    <li><strong>Format:</strong> PNG or JPG/JPEG</li>
                    <li><strong>Recommended resolution:</strong> 1920x1080 or 1280x720</li>
                    <li><strong>Aspect ratio:</strong> 16:9 works best</li>
                    <li><strong>Content:</strong> Must follow Roblox community standards (no inappropriate content)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Part 2: Configuring Your Live Game</h2>

            <h3>Accessing Game Configuration</h3>
            <p>
                While you're on your game's page on the Roblox website, you'll configure additional settings
                that control how players discover and interact with your game.
            </p>

            <div class="game-configuration">
                <h4>Key Settings to Configure</h4>

                <p><strong>Basic Settings Tab:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Game Name:</strong> Confirm it's correct</li>
                    <li><strong>Description:</strong> Paste your polished description from Mission 7.2</li>
                    <li><strong>Genre:</strong> Set to Adventure, Platformer, or most appropriate category</li>
                    <li><strong>Playable Devices:</strong> Usually keep all devices enabled (Computer, Phone, Tablet, Console)</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Access Settings Tab:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Who Can Play:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Private:</strong> Only you can play (for initial testing)</li>
                            <li><strong>Friends:</strong> You and your friends (good for classroom first launch)</li>
                            <li><strong>Public:</strong> Anyone can play (full launch)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Age Restrictions:</strong> Usually "All Ages" for a runner game</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Monetization Tab (Optional):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can skip this for your first launch</li>
                    <li>If interested, you could add Passes or Developer Products later</li>
                    <li>Focus on getting players first before monetizing</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>When to Go Public</h3>
            <p>
                You have two strategies for launching:
            </p>

            <div class="launch-strategies">
                <h4>Strategy 1: Soft Launch (Recommended for Classroom)</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Publish as "Private" or "Friends Only" first</li>
                    <li>Test the live version yourself</li>
                    <li>Share with a few classmates for feedback</li>
                    <li>Fix any issues discovered in the live environment</li>
                    <li>Then switch to "Public" for full launch</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Advantage:</strong> Safer, lets you catch any issues before public exposure</p>

                <h4>Strategy 2: Full Launch</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Publish directly as "Public"</li>
                    <li>Share immediately with everyone</li>
                    <li>Monitor and update if issues arise</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Advantage:</strong> Immediate full exposure, maximizes launch momentum</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Part 3: Verification and Testing</h2>

            <h3>Getting Your Game Link</h3>
            <p>
                Every published Roblox game has a unique URL that players use to access it. You'll need this
                link to share your game and verify it works.
            </p>

            <div class="link-instructions">
                <h4>Finding Your Game Link</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>On your game's page on the Roblox website, look at the URL in your browser's address bar</li>
                    <li>It will look something like: <code>https://www.roblox.com/games/[NUMBER]/[Your-Game-Name]</code></li>
                    <li>Copy this entire URL—this is your game's permanent link</li>
                    <li>The number is your Game ID (unique identifier for your game)</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>Alternative method:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>From your game's configuration page, look for a "View on Site" or similar button</li>
                    <li>This takes you to the public-facing game page</li>
                    <li>Copy the URL from there</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <h3>Testing Your Published Game</h3>
            <p>
                Now it's time to verify everything works in the live environment. Sometimes things behave
                differently when published versus in Studio.
            </p>

            <div class="live-testing-checklist">
                <h4>Published Game Test Checklist</h4>

                <p><strong>Test 1: Accessibility</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Open a new browser tab or window</li>
                    <li>Paste your game link and press Enter</li>
                    <li>Verify the game page loads correctly</li>
                    <li>Check that your thumbnail appears</li>
                    <li>Read your description—does it display correctly?</li>
                    <li>Check that the Play button is visible and clickable</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>Test 2: Launching the Game</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Click the green "Play" button on your game page</li>
                    <li>Wait for Roblox to launch (it should open in the Roblox Player app)</li>
                    <li>If prompted, allow the browser to open Roblox</li>
                    <li>Wait for the game to load</li>
                    <li>Verify you spawn in the correct location</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>Test 3: Gameplay Verification</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>☐ Spawn location is correct and safe</li>
                    <li>☐ All obstacles and platforms are present</li>
                    <li>☐ Controls work (WASD movement, Space to jump)</li>
                    <li>☐ All scripts are functioning (moving obstacles, collectibles, etc.)</li>
                    <li>☐ Sound effects play correctly</li>
                    <li>☐ Lighting and visual effects appear as expected</li>
                    <li>☐ Win condition works when you reach the end</li>
                    <li>☐ Respawn works if you fall or die</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Test 4: Performance Check</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Does the game run smoothly? (Check FPS in the Roblox menu)</li>
                    <li>Are there any lag spikes or freezing?</li>
                    <li>Do parts load correctly without disappearing?</li>
                    <li>Does the game feel responsive to input?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Testing from a Different Account (Optional but Recommended)</h3>
            <p>
                If possible, have a friend or classmate try accessing your game from their account. This
                verifies that permissions are set correctly and others can actually play.
            </p>

            <div class="peer-testing">
                <h4>External Access Test</h4>
                <ol>

                    <li>Ask them to click the link and try to play</li>
                    <li>If they can't access it, check your Access Settings:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Make sure "Who Can Play" is set to "Friends" (if they're your friend) or "Public"</li>
                            <li>Verify no age restrictions are blocking them</li>
                        </ul>

            <h2>Part 4: Post-Launch Monitoring</h2>

            <h3>Checking Game Statistics</h3>
            <p>
                Once your game is live, Roblox provides statistics about how it's performing. While you won't
                have many players immediately, it's good to understand what metrics are available.
            </p>

            <div class="statistics-guide">
                <h4>Where to Find Stats</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Go to <a href="https://www.roblox.com/develop">www.roblox.com/develop</a></li>
                    <li>Click on your game</li>
                    <li>Look for tabs like "Stats", "Analytics", or "Performance"</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Key Metrics to Understand</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Visits:</strong> Total number of times players have joined your game</li>
                    <li><strong>Playing:</strong> How many players are currently in your game</li>
                    <li><strong>Favorites:</strong> How many players have favorited your game</li>
                    <li><strong>Likes:</strong> Ratio of likes to dislikes (shows player satisfaction)</li>
                    <li><strong>Average Play Time:</strong> How long players stay in your game</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="metrics-insight">
                    <strong>What Good Metrics Look Like:</strong> For a student project runner, don't expect
                    thousands of visits. Instead, focus on quality metrics: Are the people who play it liking
                    it? Do they stay for the full experience? Are classmates and friends enjoying it? Those
                    matter more than raw numbers.
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Responding to Issues</h3>
            <p>
                If you discover problems in the live version or players report bugs, you can always update
                your game.
            </p>

            <div class="update-process">
                <h4>How to Update Your Published Game</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Open your game in Roblox Studio</li>
                    <li>Make your fixes or changes</li>
                    <li>Test in Studio to verify the fix works</li>
                    <li>Click "File" → "Publish to Roblox"</li>
                    <li>Select your existing game (don't create a new one)</li>
                    <li>Click "Save" to publish the update</li>
                    <li>The live version updates immediately—players already in the game will get the update
                    when they rejoin</li>
                </ol>

                <div class="update-tip">
                    <strong>Version Control:</strong> Consider keeping notes of what changes you make with
                    each update. This helps track improvements and debug issues if something breaks. Many
                    developers maintain a changelog documenting each update.
                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>Part 5: Sharing Your Game</h2>

            <h3>Ways to Share</h3>

                ways to share your creation.
            </p>

            <div class="sharing-methods">

                </ul>

                <h4>Roblox Social Features</h4>

                </ul>

                <h4>Classroom Sharing</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Share your link in your class chat or assignment submission</li>
                    <li>Prepare for the showcase presentation (next mission)</li>
                    <li>Create a QR code linking to your game for easy classroom access</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Creating a QR Code (Optional)</h3>
            <p>
                A QR code makes it easy for classmates to access your game on their phones.
            </p>

            <div class="qr-code-guide">
                <ol>
