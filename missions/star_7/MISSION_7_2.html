            <h2>Your Game's First Impression</h2>
            <p>
                You've built an incredible island runner. You've tested it, polished it, and made sure it's
                ready for players. But here's the truth: the best game in the world won't get played if nobody
                knows what it is or why they should try it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Think about how you choose which games to play on Roblox. You scroll through thumbnails, read
                descriptions, and look at ratings. You make snap judgments in seconds. Your game needs to stand
                out in that critical moment when a potential player is deciding whether to click or scroll past.
            </p>
            <p>
                This mission is about packaging your creation—taking the game you've built and presenting it
                in a way that communicates its value, its theme, and its fun factor at a glance. You're not
                just a game developer now; you're a marketer, designer, and storyteller all at once.
            </p>
            <div class="mission-insight">
                <strong>Industry Reality:</strong> Game studios have entire marketing departments dedicated to
                trailers, screenshots, and store pages. Indies often say marketing is 50% of success. The skills
                you'll practice here—visual design, compelling writing, audience awareness—are just as valuable
                as coding.

            <h2>Mission Objective</h2>
            <p>
                Configure your game's publishing settings, design an engaging thumbnail that captures your
                island's theme, write a compelling description that makes players want to visit, and set up
                proper tags and metadata to help players discover your creation.

            <h2>Part 1: Game Settings Configuration</h2>

            <h3>Accessing Game Settings</h3>
            <p>
                In Roblox Studio, you'll configure your game's core settings before publishing. These settings
                control who can play, how your game appears in search, and what features are enabled.
            </p>

            <div class="settings-guide">
                <h4>Opening Game Settings</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Open your island runner in Roblox Studio</li>
                    <li>Click <strong>File</strong> → <strong>Game Settings</strong> (or press Alt+S)</li>
                    <li>You'll see several tabs of options to configure</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Basic Info Tab</h4>
                <p>This is where you set your game's name and description.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Name:</strong> Give your game a memorable, clear title
                        <ul>
                            <li>Good: "Volcano Island Runner", "Crystal Cave Escape", "Jungle Trek Challenge"</li>
                            <li>Avoid: Generic names like "My Game" or names that don't hint at gameplay</li>
                            <li>Keep it under 50 characters so it displays well everywhere</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Description:</strong> We'll craft this in detail in the next section</li>
                    <li><strong>Genre:</strong> Select "Adventure" or "Platformer" depending on your focus</li>
                    <li><strong>Max Players:</strong> For a runner, 1-10 players is typical</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Options Tab</h4>
                <p>Configure gameplay experience options.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Enable Studio Access to API Services:</strong> Check this if you use data stores or other services</li>
                    <li><strong>Allow Private Servers:</strong> Let friends create their own instances</li>
                    <li><strong>Enable Team Create:</strong> If you worked with others, keep this on</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Permissions Tab</h4>
                <p>Control who can access your game.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Playability:</strong> Set to "Public" when ready to launch</li>
                    <li><strong>Who Can Play:</strong> "Everyone" for public access</li>
                    <li>For classroom launches, you might temporarily set to "Friends" first</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Avatar Tab</h4>
                <p>Determine what avatar options players can use.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Avatar Type:</strong> R15 is the standard (more animation options)</li>
                    <li><strong>Collision:</strong> "Outer Box" for consistent collision detection</li>
                    <li><strong>Allow Custom Avatars:</strong> Usually "Yes" to let players use their avatars</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Tags and Metadata</h3>
            <p>
                These help players discover your game when browsing or searching Roblox. Think about what
                words describe your game best.
            </p>

            <div class="tagging-guide">
                <h4>Choosing Effective Tags</h4>
                <p>Select tags that accurately represent your game. Examples for an island runner:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Gameplay:</strong> Obby, Runner, Parkour, Adventure, Challenge</li>
                    <li><strong>Theme:</strong> Island, Tropical, Nature, Jungle, Beach, Volcano</li>
                    <li><strong>Style:</strong> Colorful, Casual, Fun, Exploration</li>
                    <li><strong>Experience:</strong> Singleplayer, Short, Beginner-Friendly</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="tagging-tip">
                    <strong>Strategy:</strong> Use tags that players actually search for. "Obby" is heavily
                    searched on Roblox. "Runner" and "Parkour" are common. Mix popular generic tags with
                    specific theme tags to appear in both broad and niche searches.
                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>Part 2: Crafting Your Game Description</h2>

            <h3>The Purpose of a Description</h3>
            <p>
                Your description answers three questions for potential players: What is this game? Why should
                I play it? What will I do? You have limited space to hook their interest, so every word counts.
            </p>

            <div class="description-framework">
                <h4>The Three-Part Description Structure</h4>

                <p><strong>Part 1: The Hook (1-2 sentences)</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Start with an exciting statement that immediately tells players what your game is and why
                    it's interesting. Use vivid language that connects to your island's theme.
                </p>
                <div class="example-box">
                    <strong>Examples:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"Race across a volcano island as lava rises behind you! Can you reach the rescue helicopter before the island explodes?"</li>
                        <li>"Explore a mysterious crystal cave filled with jumping challenges and hidden secrets. Your island adventure awaits!"</li>
                        <li>"Navigate the dangers of a tropical jungle island in this challenging runner. Leap over ravines, dodge falling coconuts, and find your way home!"</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p><strong>Part 2: The Details (2-4 sentences)</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Explain the core gameplay and what makes your game unique. Mention specific features,
                    obstacles, or mechanics that set your runner apart.
                </p>
                <div class="example-box">
                    <strong>Example:</strong>
                    <p>
                        "Jump across floating platforms, swing on vines, and collect ancient coins as you
                        traverse the island. Each section brings new challenges—from beach parkour to
                        mountain climbing. Master the timing, avoid the traps, and prove you have what it
                        takes to conquer the island!"
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p><strong>Part 3: The Call to Action (1 sentence)</strong></p>
                <p>
                    End with an invitation that encourages players to try your game. Make it enthusiastic and welcoming.
                </p>
                <div class="example-box">
                    <strong>Examples:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"Can you escape the island? Jump in and find out!"</li>
                        <li>"The adventure starts now—will you make it to the end?"</li>
                        <li>"Your island challenge awaits. Ready to run?"</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Description Writing Tips</h3>
            <div class="writing-tips">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Use action verbs:</strong> Jump, race, explore, navigate, conquer, escape</li>
                    <li><strong>Be specific:</strong> Don't just say "obstacles"—name them (ravines, traps, lava)</li>
                    <li><strong>Create urgency:</strong> Use words like "before," "can you," "race against"</li>
                    <li><strong>Show personality:</strong> Let your island's theme and story come through</li>
                    <li><strong>Keep it concise:</strong> Aim for 100-150 words total</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid clichés:</strong> Skip phrases like "fun for everyone" or "amazing game"</li>
                    <li><strong>No ALL CAPS:</strong> Use proper capitalization for readability</li>
                    <li><strong>Proofread:</strong> Check spelling and grammar—errors look unprofessional</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Part 3: Creating Your Thumbnail</h2>

            <h3>Why Thumbnails Matter</h3>
            <p>
                Your thumbnail is the first thing players see when browsing games. It needs to instantly
                communicate what your game is about and look appealing enough to make players want to click.
                A great thumbnail can be the difference between 10 plays and 1,000 plays.
            </p>

            <div class="thumbnail-principles">
                <h4>Principles of Effective Thumbnails</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Clear focal point:</strong> One main subject or scene that draws the eye</li>
                    <li><strong>Readable at small sizes:</strong> Looks good even as a tiny icon</li>
                    <li><strong>High contrast:</strong> Bold colors that stand out from other games</li>
                    <li><strong>Minimal text:</strong> Game title only, in large readable font</li>
                    <li><strong>Action or drama:</strong> Shows something exciting happening</li>
                    <li><strong>Represents gameplay:</strong> Accurately depicts what players will experience</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Method 1: In-Studio Screenshot</h3>
            <p>
                The simplest approach is taking a screenshot directly from your game that captures its best angle.
            </p>

            <div class="screenshot-guide">
                <h4>Steps for a Great Screenshot</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Find the best angle:</strong> Move your camera to show your island's most
                    impressive or characteristic view
                        <ul>
                            <li>Try different heights and distances</li>
                            <li>Frame interesting obstacles or landmarks</li>
                            <li>Consider a dramatic angle (low looking up, or high looking down)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Improve the lighting:</strong> Adjust time of day or add temporary lights to
                    make the scene pop</li>
                    <li><strong>Add action:</strong> Include your avatar in a jumping or running pose</li>
                    <li><strong>Hide UI:</strong> Press Ctrl+Shift+B to hide Studio interface elements</li>
                    <li><strong>Take the screenshot:</strong> Use your computer's screenshot tool
                        <ul>
                            <li>Windows: Windows Key + Shift + S (Snipping Tool)</li>
                            <li>Mac: Command + Shift + 4</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Crop to 16:9 ratio:</strong> Thumbnails work best at 1920x1080 or 1280x720 pixels</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <h3>Method 2: Test Mode Screenshot</h3>
            <p>
                Playing your game in test mode can capture more dynamic action shots.
            </p>

            <div class="action-shot-guide">
                <ol>
                    <li>Press F5 or click "Play" to test your game</li>
                    <li>Play until you reach a visually exciting moment (mid-jump, approaching an obstacle)</li>
                    <li>Pause your game by pressing Escape</li>
                    <li>Adjust camera angle if needed</li>
                    <li>Take your screenshot</li>
                    <li>Press F5 again to exit test mode</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <h3>Adding Text to Your Thumbnail (Optional)</h3>
            <p>
                If you want to add your game title as text overlay, you can use free tools like:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Paint.NET</strong> (Windows) - Free image editor with text tools</li>
                <li><strong>GIMP</strong> (Windows/Mac/Linux) - More advanced free editor</li>
                <li><strong>Canva</strong> (Web-based) - Easy drag-and-drop design tool</li>
                <li><strong>Photopea</strong> (Web-based) - Free Photoshop alternative</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="text-overlay-tips">
                <h4>Text Overlay Best Practices</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Font size:</strong> Very large—should be readable at thumbnail size</li>
                    <li><strong>Font style:</strong> Bold, thick fonts work best (avoid thin or script fonts)</li>
                    <li><strong>Color:</strong> High contrast with background (white text with black outline often works)</li>
                    <li><strong>Placement:</strong> Top or bottom third, not covering the main action</li>
                    <li><strong>Length:</strong> Keep it short—your full game name or even just a key word</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Thumbnail Inspiration Checklist</h3>
            <div class="thumbnail-checklist">
                <p>Evaluate your thumbnail with these questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>☐ Can I tell what the game is about from the image alone?</li>
                    <li>☐ Does it look appealing and exciting?</li>
                    <li>☐ Is there good contrast and color?</li>
                    <li>☐ Would this stand out among other game thumbnails?</li>
                    <li>☐ Is any text large and readable at small sizes?</li>
                    <li>☐ Does it accurately represent my game?</li>
                    <li>☐ Would I click on this if I saw it?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Part 4: Preview and Polish</h2>

            <h3>The Pre-Publish Review</h3>
            <p>
                Before you hit publish, review everything one more time with fresh eyes. Read your description
                aloud—does it sound exciting? Look at your thumbnail small—does it still look good? Check
                your game name—is it clear and memorable?
            </p>

            <div class="final-review-checklist">
                <h4>Publishing Setup Checklist</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>☐ Game name is clear, memorable, and under 50 characters</li>
                    <li>☐ Description has a hook, details, and call to action</li>
                    <li>☐ Description is 100-150 words, proofread, and error-free</li>
                    <li>☐ Genre and tags accurately represent the game</li>
                    <li>☐ Max players is set appropriately (1-10 for most runners)</li>

                <h4>The Psychology of Game Discovery</h4>
                <p>
                    Research shows players decide whether to try a game in about 2-3 seconds of seeing it.
                    Your thumbnail needs to trigger curiosity or excitement instantly. Your description needs
                    to convert that curiosity into a click. Studios spend thousands on this process—A/B testing
                    different thumbnails, rewriting descriptions, analyzing click-through rates. You're learning
                    the foundations of user acquisition and conversion, core skills in the game industry.

            <h3>Getting Feedback</h3>
            <p>
                Before finalizing, show your thumbnail and description to a friend or classmate. Ask:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Based on this, what do you think the game is about?"</li>
                <li>"Would you click on this? Why or why not?"</li>
                <li>"What catches your eye first?"</li>
                <li>"Is anything confusing or unclear?"</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If their answers don't match what you intended, revise. Your materials should communicate
                clearly without you having to explain them.

                <strong>Presentation Standard:</strong> Your game's presentation should look professional and
                inviting. Players should immediately understand what your game is about from the thumbnail and
                description. If you feel confident showing this to the Roblox community, you're ready.
