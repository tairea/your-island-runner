            <h2>The Final Countdown</h2>
            <p>
                Your island runner is almost ready for the world. You've built the terrain, crafted the obstacles,
                tuned the mechanics, and polished every detail. But before you hit that publish button, there's
                one critical step that separates good games from great ones: the final bug hunt.
            </p>
            <p>
                Professional game studios have entire quality assurance teams dedicated to this phase. Today,
                you'll learn their systematic approach to finding and fixing issues before launch. This isn't
                just clicking around randomly—it's a methodical process that ensures your players have the best
                possible experience from the moment they spawn into your world.
            </p>
            <div class="mission-insight">
                <strong>Real-World Insight:</strong> Game studios often delay launch dates to ensure quality.
                The saying "a delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad" has become
                industry wisdom. Your final bug hunt is your quality guarantee.

            <h2>Mission Objective</h2>
            <p>
                Conduct a systematic playtest of your island runner, identify any remaining bugs or issues,
                and fix them to ensure a smooth launch experience. You'll test normal gameplay, edge cases,
                and create a pre-launch checklist to verify everything works perfectly.
            </p>

        <section class="mission-content-main">
            <h2>The Systematic Testing Method</h2>

            <h3>Phase 1: Fresh Start Test</h3>
            <p>
                Begin by testing the complete new player experience. Close and restart Roblox Studio to simulate
                a fresh visit to your game.
            </p>

            <div class="testing-checklist">
                <h4>Spawn Experience</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Spawn safely?</strong> Do players spawn on solid ground, not inside objects or falling through the world?</li>
                    <li><strong>Clear direction?</strong> Is it immediately obvious where to go and what to do?</li>
                    <li><strong>Instructions visible?</strong> Can new players see your starting instructions or signs?</li>
                    <li><strong>Camera position?</strong> Does the camera start at a good angle to see the course?</li>
                    <li><strong>No immediate death?</strong> Can players take a moment to orient themselves without dying?</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>First Playthrough</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Complete the course</strong> from start to finish without developer knowledge</li>
                    <li><strong>Note any confusion</strong> about where to go or what to do</li>
                    <li><strong>Check difficulty</strong> - Is the learning curve reasonable?</li>
                    <li><strong>Test all mechanics</strong> - Do jumps, obstacles, and collectibles work?</li>
                    <li><strong>Verify win condition</strong> - Does finishing properly trigger victory?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Phase 2: Edge Case Testing</h3>
            <p>
                Now it's time to be creative—try to break your game. Edge cases are unusual situations that
                players might stumble into, and they often reveal bugs.
            </p>

            <div class="edge-case-scenarios">
                <h4>Things to Try</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Jump off the map</strong> - What happens if players deliberately jump into the void?</li>
                    <li><strong>Go backwards</strong> - Can players break the sequence by going the wrong way?</li>
                    <li><strong>Stand still</strong> - What if a player just waits at spawn for 30 seconds?</li>
                    <li><strong>Rapid clicking</strong> - Do your buttons or triggers break with spam clicking?</li>
                    <li><strong>Die repeatedly</strong> - Does respawning work correctly every time?</li>
                    <li><strong>Wall climbing</strong> - Can players get stuck on or inside walls?</li>
                    <li><strong>Collectible sequence</strong> - What if players get collectibles in the wrong order?</li>
                    <li><strong>Multiple attempts</strong> - Does restarting or replaying cause any issues?</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="testing-tip">
                    <strong>Testing Mindset:</strong> Imagine you're a curious player who wants to explore
                    every corner. Or imagine you're a player who doesn't follow instructions. What could go wrong?
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Phase 3: Polish Check</h3>
            <p>
                This is your final visual and audio sweep. Look at your game with fresh eyes and check that
                all the polish you added in Star 6 is working correctly.
            </p>

            <div class="polish-verification">
                <h4>Visual Elements</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Lighting</strong> - Does it look good at all points in the course?</li>
                    <li><strong>Textures</strong> - Are all materials applied correctly with no missing textures?</li>
                    <li><strong>Effects</strong> - Do particle effects play at the right times?</li>
                    <li><strong>Signs and UI</strong> - Is all text readable and properly positioned?</li>
                    <li><strong>Theme consistency</strong> - Does everything fit your island's visual style?</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Audio Elements</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sound effects</strong> - Do they trigger correctly for actions and events?</li>
                    <li><strong>Volume levels</strong> - Is everything balanced (not too loud or quiet)?</li>
                    <li><strong>Music loops</strong> - Does background music play and loop smoothly?</li>
                    <li><strong>Spatial audio</strong> - Do sounds come from the right locations?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Phase 4: Bug Documentation and Fixing</h3>
            <p>
                As you test, keep track of every issue you find. Not all bugs are equal—some need immediate
                fixes, while others are minor polish items.
            </p>

            <div class="bug-priority-guide">
                <h4>Critical (Must Fix Before Launch)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Game crashes or breaks completely</li>
                    <li>Players get stuck and can't continue</li>
                    <li>Win condition doesn't work</li>
                    <li>Spawn or respawn fails</li>
                    <li>Major collision issues (falling through world)</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>High Priority (Fix If Possible)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Frustrating difficulty spikes</li>
                    <li>Confusing navigation or unclear objectives</li>
                    <li>Broken mechanics or features</li>
                    <li>Visual glitches that distract from gameplay</li>
                    <li>Missing feedback for player actions</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Low Priority (Nice to Fix)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Minor visual inconsistencies</li>
                    <li>Small polish improvements</li>
                    <li>Extra features you'd like to add</li>
                    <li>Optimization opportunities</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Phase 5: Peer Testing</h3>
            <p>
                If possible, have a classmate play your game without any guidance. Watch them play but don't
                help or explain anything. This reveals what's intuitive and what's confusing.
            </p>

            <div class="peer-testing-guide">
                <h4>What to Observe</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>First reactions</strong> - Do they understand what to do immediately?</li>
                    <li><strong>Stuck points</strong> - Where do they pause or seem confused?</li>
                    <li><strong>Unexpected behavior</strong> - Do they try things you didn't anticipate?</li>
                    <li><strong>Enjoyment</strong> - Do they seem engaged and having fun?</li>
                    <li><strong>Completion</strong> - Can they finish without your help?</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Questions to Ask After</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>What was your first impression?</li>
                    <li>Was anything confusing or unclear?</li>
                    <li>Did you encounter any bugs or issues?</li>
                    <li>What did you enjoy most?</li>
                    <li>Any suggestions for improvement?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>The Pre-Launch Checklist</h3>
            <p>
                Before you move on to publishing, verify every item on this final checklist:
            </p>

            <div class="launch-readiness-checklist">

                </ul>

                <h4>Player Experience Verification</h4>

                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="pro-developer-insight">
                <h4>How Professionals Hunt Bugs</h4>
                <p>
                    Professional QA testers use structured test plans and bug tracking systems. They test the
                    same scenarios repeatedly to ensure fixes don't break other features (regression testing).
                    Some studios even have "game breaking" teams whose job is to intentionally try to break the
                    game in creative ways. The process you're learning here mirrors real industry practices.

        <section class="mission-check">
            <h2>Mission Check</h2>
            <p>Before moving to the next mission, verify you've completed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tested your game from a fresh start (complete playthrough)</li>
                <li>Attempted to break your game with edge case testing</li>
                <li>Verified all polish elements (lighting, sound, visuals)</li>
                <li>Fixed all critical bugs that would prevent players from enjoying your game</li>
                <li>Had at least one other person playtest (if possible)</li>
                <li>Completed the pre-launch checklist</li>
                <li>Your game is stable, playable, and ready for the public</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Quality Threshold:</strong> Your game doesn't need to be perfect, but it should be
                solid. Critical bugs should be fixed. Players should be able to complete the course. The
                experience should be smooth and enjoyable. If you can confidently say "I'd be proud to share
                this," you're ready for launch.
