        <h1>Mission 2.1: Satellite Exploration</h1>
        <p class="hook-text">
            Imagine you're a pilot flying high above your hometown, looking down at the streets you walk every day. From up here, everything looks different. Your school becomes a tiny rectangle. The park where you hang out transforms into a patch of green. Roads become thin lines connecting it all together. This is the view satellites capture from space, and today, you're going to become an expert at finding and navigating this bird's-eye perspective of your world.
        </p>
        <p class="hook-question">
            What will your neighborhood look like from space? Let's find out.

        <h2>Mission Objective</h2>
        <p>
            Navigate Google Maps satellite view to locate and capture a clear aerial image of your local area that will become the foundation of your island runner game.

        <h2>Your Satellite Mission</h2>
        <p>
            Every great game designer starts with research. Before you can build your island runner in Roblox, you need to study the real geography you're recreating. Google Maps satellite view gives you access to the same technology that helps pilots navigate, urban planners design cities, and yes, game developers create realistic environments.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 1: Launch Your Satellite View</h3>
        <p>
            Open your web browser and navigate to <strong>maps.google.com</strong>. You'll see the familiar map interface with roads, labels, and colored regions. But we're going to switch to something much cooler.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Look for the <strong>Layers</strong> button in the bottom-left corner of the map</li>
            <li>Click on it and select <strong>Satellite</strong> from the menu</li>
            <li>Watch your map transform from a diagram into a photograph taken from space</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="try-it-box">
            <h4>Try It: First Impressions</h4>
            <p>
                When you first switch to satellite view, take a moment to explore wherever the map is currently showing. Notice how buildings cast shadows. See how you can tell the difference between grass, concrete, and water just by color and texture. This is real photography captured by satellites orbiting Earth.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Step 2: Navigate to Your Territory</h3>
        <p>
            Now it's time to find your local area. You have several options for getting there:
        </p>

        <h4>Option A: Use the Search Bar</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Click the search bar at the top of the screen</li>
            <li>Type your school address, your home address, or a well-known landmark near you</li>
            <li>Press Enter and watch Google Maps fly you to that location</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Option B: Use Your Location</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Look for the small circular button with a target/crosshair icon (usually on the right side)</li>
            <li>Click it to center the map on your current location</li>
            <li>You may need to give your browser permission to access your location</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Option C: Manual Navigation</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Click and drag the map to pan around</li>
            <li>Use the + and - buttons to zoom in and out</li>
            <li>Navigate your way to your local area like a true explorer</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <h4>Navigation Tip</h4>
            <p>
                You can also use your mouse wheel or trackpad to zoom in and out. Scroll up to zoom in, scroll down to zoom out. This is much faster than clicking the + and - buttons once you get the hang of it.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Step 3: Find the Perfect View</h3>
        <p>
            Now comes the fun part: finding the absolute best satellite view of your area. This isn't just about zooming in randomly. You're looking for a view that tells a story and gives you interesting geography to work with.
        </p>

        <h4>What Makes a Great View?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clear boundaries</strong>: Can you see where your neighborhood ends? Is there a coastline, a river, a major road, or a park that creates a natural border?</li>
            <li><strong>Interesting landmarks</strong>: Do you see recognizable buildings, parks, sports fields, or unique features?</li>
            <li><strong>Variety of terrain</strong>: The best game maps have different types of areas - maybe you have buildings, green spaces, water, and roads all visible</li>
            <li><strong>Good scale</strong>: Zoom to a level where you can see details but also get a sense of the whole area. Too close and you'll only see one building; too far and everything becomes a blur</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="try-it-box">
            <h4>Try It: The Goldilocks Zoom</h4>
            <p>
                Zoom all the way out until your entire town is just a small dot. Now zoom all the way in until you can see individual cars in a parking lot. The perfect zoom level is somewhere in between - where you can see about 10-20 buildings or city blocks at once. This gives you enough detail to plan with, while showing how everything connects together.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h4>Adjust Your Perspective</h4>
        <p>
            Google Maps lets you do more than just zoom. Try these advanced controls:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tilt view</strong>: Hold Shift and drag the mouse to tilt the view and see buildings from an angle (works best in urban areas)</li>
            <li><strong>Rotate</strong>: Hold Ctrl (or Cmd on Mac) and drag to rotate the map to face a different direction</li>
            <li><strong>Street View</strong>: Drag the little yellow person icon onto any blue-highlighted road to see a ground-level photo view</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            For your island runner, you'll want a straight-down overhead view (the default), but it's worth experimenting with these controls to see your area from every angle.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 4: Capture Your Satellite Image</h3>
        <p>
            Once you've found the perfect view, it's time to save it. You'll need this image later when you start building in Roblox Studio. Taking a screenshot is your mission-critical task here.
        </p>

        <h4>How to Take a Screenshot</h4>
        <p>
            The exact method depends on your device:
        </p>

        <h5>Windows PC:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Method 1</strong>: Press <kbd>Windows Key + Shift + S</kbd> to open the Snipping Tool. Click and drag to select just the map area.</li>
            <li><strong>Method 2</strong>: Press <kbd>Print Screen</kbd> to capture the entire screen, then paste into Paint and crop</li>
            <li><strong>Method 3</strong>: Use the Snipping Tool app from the Start menu</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Mac:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Method 1</strong>: Press <kbd>Command + Shift + 4</kbd>, then click and drag to select the map area</li>
            <li><strong>Method 2</strong>: Press <kbd>Command + Shift + 3</kbd> to capture the entire screen</li>
            <li>Screenshots automatically save to your Desktop</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Chromebook:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Method 1</strong>: Press <kbd>Ctrl + Shift + Show Windows</kbd> (the key with a rectangle and two lines), then select an area</li>
            <li><strong>Method 2</strong>: Press <kbd>Ctrl + Show Windows</kbd> to capture the full screen</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <h4>Screenshot Success Tips</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Before taking the screenshot, hide any unnecessary labels or UI elements if Google Maps allows it</li>
                <li>Make sure the entire area you want is visible on screen</li>
                <li>Save your screenshot with a clear name like "my_island_satellite.png" so you can find it later</li>
                <li>Save it in a folder dedicated to your island runner project</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>What to Capture</h4>
        <p>
            Your screenshot should include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>An area roughly 0.5 to 2 square kilometers (about 4-16 city blocks)</li>
            <li>Clear identifiable landmarks you recognize</li>
            <li>Natural or human-made boundaries that could define your game world's edges</li>
            <li>A variety of terrain and features to make your game interesting</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="try-it-box">
            <h4>Try It: Multiple Options</h4>
            <p>
                Don't settle for your first screenshot. Take 3-4 different screenshots of your area at different zoom levels or from different locations nearby. You can choose the best one later. Maybe your school area is interesting, but so is the park near your house. Maybe a tight zoom on downtown is cool, but so is a wider view that includes the waterfront. Give yourself options!
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Step 5: Study Your Territory</h3>
        <p>
            Now that you have your satellite image, take some time to really look at it. You're not just playing with maps - you're doing what real game developers do: location scouting and research.
        </p>

        <h4>Questions to Ask Yourself:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>What's the most interesting feature you can see?</li>
            <li>Where do you spend time in this area in real life?</li>
            <li>What paths do people walk or drive through here?</li>
            <li>What buildings or landmarks would make cool obstacle stations?</li>
            <li>If you were running through this area in real life, what route would be the most fun?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            These questions will help you in the next missions when you start planning your actual game route and identifying landmarks.
        </p>

        <div class="inspiration-box">
            <h4>Real-World Connection</h4>
            <p>
                Game developers use satellite imagery and real-world locations all the time. Games like Grand Theft Auto recreate entire cities from satellite maps. Racing games scan real race tracks. Even fantasy games start with research into real castles, forests, and mountains. You're using the exact same tools and techniques that professional game developers use to create realistic, immersive game worlds.
