        <h1>Mission 2.3: Landmark Hunt</h1>
        <p class="hook-text">
            Every runner knows that a good course needs checkpoints - destinations that break up the journey and give you something to aim for. In a race, these might be water stations or kilometer markers. In your island runner game, they'll be obstacle stations built at real locations from your local area. That basketball court where you play pickup games? The weird statue in the park? The old church with the tall spire? Each of these could become a challenge point in your game.
        </p>
        <p class="hook-question">
            Which 5 locations in your island deserve to become legendary obstacle stations? Let's find out.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="mission-objective">
        <h2>Mission Objective</h2>
        <p>
            Select 5 distinctive real-world locations within your island boundaries that will become obstacle stations in your island runner game, ensuring good spatial distribution and gameplay variety.

        <h2>Understanding Obstacle Stations</h2>
        <p>
            In your island runner game, obstacle stations are special locations where players must complete a challenge before moving on to the next station. Think of them as mini-levels within your larger world. Each station needs to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Be recognizable in the satellite image</li>
            <li>Be visually distinctive from other stations</li>
            <li>Inspire ideas for what kind of obstacle could go there</li>
            <li>Fit logically into your island's overall geography</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 1: Study Your Island</h3>
        <p>
            Pull up your satellite image with the traced boundary outline from Mission 2.2. You're going to study every detail of what's inside those boundaries, looking for standout locations.
        </p>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <h4>Switch Perspectives</h4>
            <p>
                Look at your satellite image in Google Maps, but also toggle between Satellite view and regular Map view. The map view shows building labels, street names, and points of interest that might not be obvious from the satellite photo alone. A building that looks ordinary from above might be labeled as "Community Center" or "Historic Library" - instant landmark potential!
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Step 2: Landmark Categories</h3>
        <p>
            Good obstacle stations come in many forms. Let's explore the types of landmarks you might find in your island, along with what makes each type special for game design.
        </p>

        <h4>Buildings & Structures</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Schools</strong>: Large, rectangular, usually with sports fields - excellent for central hub stations</li>
            <li><strong>Churches/Temples</strong>: Distinctive architecture, often with towers or unique shapes</li>
            <li><strong>Libraries or Community Centers</strong>: Public buildings with cultural significance</li>
            <li><strong>Shopping Centers or Markets</strong>: Large footprints, lots of activity, busy zones</li>
            <li><strong>Stadiums or Arenas</strong>: Circular or oval shapes, massive scale</li>
            <li><strong>Unique Buildings</strong>: Anything with unusual shape, color, or historical significance</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Outdoor Spaces</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Parks</strong>: Green spaces visible from satellite, natural gathering places</li>
            <li><strong>Playgrounds</strong>: Small but distinctive, often with equipment visible from above</li>
            <li><strong>Sports Fields</strong>: Soccer fields, baseball diamonds, basketball courts - geometric and colorful</li>
            <li><strong>Plazas or Squares</strong>: Open urban spaces, often at intersections</li>
            <li><strong>Gardens or Green Spaces</strong>: Areas with distinctive landscaping patterns</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Transportation & Infrastructure</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bridges</strong>: Dramatic crossing points over water or roads</li>
            <li><strong>Train or Bus Stations</strong>: Transit hubs where people gather</li>
            <li><strong>Parking Lots</strong>: Large paved areas (could become challenge arenas)</li>
            <li><strong>Roundabouts or Traffic Circles</strong>: Distinctive circular patterns</li>
            <li><strong>Harbors or Docks</strong>: Water-land interfaces with boats and piers</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Natural Features</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Beaches or Shorelines</strong>: Where land meets water</li>
            <li><strong>Hills or Elevated Points</strong>: Visible as terrain variation and shadows</li>
            <li><strong>Rivers or Streams</strong>: Flowing water creating linear features</li>
            <li><strong>Wooded Areas</strong>: Clusters of trees, darker green patches</li>
            <li><strong>Ponds or Lakes</strong>: Small bodies of water within your island</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="try-it-box">
            <h4>Try It: Category Scout</h4>
            <p>
                Set a timer for 5 minutes. During this time, identify as many potential landmarks as you can in your island, organizing them by category. Don't judge or filter yet - just find and list everything you can see. Try to find at least 10-15 possibilities. This gives you plenty of options to choose from in the next steps.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Step 3: Selection Criteria</h3>
        <p>
            You probably found more than 5 potential landmarks. Now comes the hard part: choosing which ones make the final cut. Use these criteria to evaluate each candidate:
        </p>

        <h4>1. Visual Distinctiveness</h4>
        <p>
            Can you clearly see and identify this landmark in the satellite image? The best landmarks have:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Unique shapes (circles, triangles, unusual geometry)</li>
            <li>Different colors than surroundings (green park vs. gray buildings)</li>
            <li>Distinctive patterns (sports field lines, parking lot rows)</li>
            <li>Notable size (much bigger or smaller than nearby structures)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>2. Personal Connection</h4>
        <p>
            Do you have a relationship with this place? The best landmarks are ones you know:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Places you visit regularly</li>
            <li>Locations with memories or stories attached</li>
            <li>Spots your friends would recognize</li>
            <li>Landmarks that mean something to your community</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>3. Obstacle Potential</h4>
        <p>
            Can you imagine what kind of obstacle course could exist here? Think about:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>What the space offers (open area, vertical structure, water nearby?)</li>
            <li>What activities happen here in real life</li>
            <li>What challenges fit the location's character</li>
            <li>How the real-world function could inspire game mechanics</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>4. Spatial Distribution</h4>
        <p>
            Where is this landmark relative to others? Good station placement means:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stations spread across your island, not all clustered together</li>
            <li>Roughly even distances between consecutive stations</li>
            <li>Coverage of different areas and terrain types</li>
            <li>Natural flow from one station to the next</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="decision-box">
            <h4>The Magic Number: Why 5?</h4>
            <p>
                Five stations is the sweet spot for your first island runner. It's enough to create a real journey with variety, but not so many that you'll spend forever building. Five stations also creates good pacing - start, three middle challenges, and a finale. As you gain experience, you can always add more stations later, but start with five to keep your project manageable and achievable.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Step 4: The Selection Process</h3>
        <p>
            Now let's systematically narrow down your list of potential landmarks to the final five.
        </p>

        <h4>Round 1: Must-Haves</h4>
        <p>
            Look at your list of potential landmarks. Are there any that are absolute must-haves? These might be:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The most iconic or recognizable landmark in your area</li>
            <li>A place with deep personal significance</li>
            <li>The most visually striking feature in your satellite image</li>
            <li>A location that perfectly captures what your island is about</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Mark 1-2 landmarks as definite selections. These are your anchors - the rest of your stations will be chosen to work well with these.
        </p>

        <h4>Round 2: Spatial Balance</h4>
        <p>
            Open an image editor or grab a pen and your printed satellite image. Mark the locations of your must-have landmarks. Now divide your island into rough zones (north/south/east/west, or quadrants, or however makes sense for your shape).
        </p>
        <p>
            Look for landmarks that fill in the gaps:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>If your must-haves are in the north, choose stations in the south</li>
            <li>If you have east and west covered, find something central</li>
            <li>Aim for a distribution where stations feel spread out, not clumped</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Round 3: Variety Check</h4>
        <p>
            Look at the landmarks you've selected so far. Do you have variety in types? Ideally, your five stations should include different categories:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mix buildings with outdoor spaces</li>
            <li>Include both large and small landmarks</li>
            <li>Combine natural features with human-made structures</li>
            <li>Balance public spaces with distinctive architecture</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Variety keeps your game interesting and showcases different aspects of your island.
        </p>

        <h4>Round 4: Final Picks</h4>
        <p>
            If you're down to exactly 5 landmarks, great! If you still have more, make your final cuts based on:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Which ones you're most excited to build</li>
            <li>Which ones create the best route flow (we'll explore this in Mission 2.4)</li>
            <li>Which ones you can most clearly see in your satellite image</li>
            <li>Which ones feel most essential to representing your island</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="try-it-box">
            <h4>Try It: The Elevator Pitch</h4>
            <p>
                For each of your 5 selected landmarks, write a one-sentence description that captures what makes it special. For example: "The old brick library with the copper dome where the city was founded." Or: "The basketball court behind the school where everyone plays after class." These sentences help you articulate why each landmark deserves its spot in your game.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Step 5: Mark Your Stations</h3>
        <p>
            Now make your selections visible and concrete.
        </p>

        <h4>Digital Marking Method:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Open your satellite image with the traced boundary in an image editor</li>
            <li>Choose a bright, easily visible color (different from your boundary line)</li>
            <li>Place numbered markers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) at each landmark location</li>
            <li>The numbers don't have to represent route order yet - just label them for reference</li>
            <li>Make the markers big enough to see clearly</li>
            <li>Save this version as "my_island_landmarks.png" or similar</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Paper Marking Method:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Print your satellite image or use your previously marked version</li>
            <li>Use stickers, stars, or numbered circles to mark each landmark</li>
            <li>Write the landmark name next to each marker</li>
            <li>Take a photo of the marked-up map to save it digitally</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <h4>Backup Choices</h4>
            <p>
                Keep your list of runner-up landmarks somewhere safe. If you discover later that one of your five stations doesn't work well (maybe it's too close to another, or you can't think of a good obstacle for it), you'll want backup options ready to swap in. Don't delete that brainstorming list!
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Step 6: Create Your Landmark Registry</h3>
        <p>
            Professional game designers keep detailed documentation of all important locations in their game worlds. Let's create a simple registry for your landmarks.
        </p>

        <p>
            Open a text document, note-taking app, or piece of paper and create entries for each landmark with this information:
        </p>

        <h4>Landmark Registry Template:</h4>
        <pre>
LANDMARK #1: [Name]
Type: [Building/Outdoor Space/Natural Feature/Infrastructure]
Description: [One sentence capturing what it is]
Why I chose it: [Personal connection or visual appeal]
Satellite characteristics: [What makes it visible from above]
Obstacle ideas: [Initial thoughts - can be vague for now]

LANDMARK #2: [Name]
[Repeat for all 5 landmarks]
        </pre>

        <p>
            This registry serves multiple purposes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Documents your design decisions</li>
            <li>Helps you remember why you chose each location</li>
            <li>Creates a reference guide for when you start building</li>
            <li>Gives you a place to brainstorm obstacle ideas</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="try-it-box">
            <h4>Try It: Stranger's Perspective</h4>
            <p>
                Imagine someone who has never visited your island is looking at your satellite image with the 5 landmarks marked. Based only on what they can see from above, would they understand why you chose each landmark? If not, think about what makes each location special beyond what's visible in the satellite image. This hidden context will enrich your game design and might inspire obstacle ideas later.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>What Makes a Landmark Legendary?</h3>
        <p>
            The best landmarks in games aren't just visually interesting - they tell stories and create memories. Think about iconic game locations you remember:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The first castle in Super Mario Bros - simple but unforgettable</li>
            <li>Hyrule Castle in Zelda - visible from anywhere, drawing you toward it</li>
            <li>The lighthouse in BioShock - a beginning and an ending point</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Your landmarks have the advantage of being real places with real history and significance. A game location based on the park where your community gathers for festivals has built-in meaning. The school where generations of students have learned carries weight. The bridge that connects two neighborhoods tells a story of connection.
        </p>

        <p>
            Don't underestimate the power of local significance. To someone from across the world, your landmarks might seem ordinary. But to you and your community, they're special - and that specialness will shine through in how you design and build them.
        </p>

        <div class="inspiration-box">
            <h4>Real-World Connection</h4>
            <p>
                Game developers call these kinds of memorable locations "POIs" - Points of Interest. In open-world games, POIs serve as navigation waypoints, quest locations, and memorable setpieces that make the game world feel rich and explorable. By selecting your 5 landmarks, you're doing exactly what developers at companies like Nintendo, Rockstar, and Ubisoft do when designing game worlds: identifying the locations that will anchor the player's experience and create a sense of place.
            </p>

    <div class="mission-check">
        <h2>Mission Check</h2>
        <p>Before you complete this mission, verify you have:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Studied your satellite image to identify potential landmarks</li>
            <li>Listed at least 10-15 possible landmark locations</li>
            <li>Evaluated candidates using selection criteria (visual, personal, spatial, variety)</li>
            <li>Selected exactly 5 landmarks for your obstacle stations</li>
            <li>Ensured good spatial distribution across your island</li>
            <li>Included variety in landmark types and categories</li>
            <li>Marked all 5 landmarks on your satellite image (numbered or labeled)</li>
            <li>Created a Landmark Registry with details for each location</li>
            <li>Written at least one sentence explaining what makes each landmark special</li>
            <li>Saved your marked-up satellite image showing all landmarks</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Next Mission: Story Your Route</h2>
        <p>
            You have your island boundaries. You have your 5 landmark stations. But right now they're just disconnected dots on a map. In Mission 2.4, you'll connect these landmarks into a meaningful route and create a narrative reason for why a runner would travel through them. Every great game has a story - what will yours be?
