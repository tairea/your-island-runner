        <p class="hook-text">
            Manhattan is a rectangle. San Francisco is a square that got squished and bent. Italy is a boot. Every place has a shape, whether it's carved by ocean waves over millions of years or drawn by city planners with rulers and ambition. Your game world needs boundaries - edges where the playable area ends - and the best boundaries are ones that feel natural and make sense.

        <h2>Understanding Game Boundaries</h2>
        <p>
            Every game world has edges. In your island runner, players need to know where they can and can't go. The best boundaries feel natural and make sense in the context of your world. You don't want arbitrary invisible walls - you want logical borders that players understand intuitively.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 1: Open Your Satellite Image</h3>
        <p>
            Pull up the screenshot you saved from Mission 2.1. Look at it not as a map of places you know, but as a shape puzzle. Imagine you're looking at an island from an airplane, and you need to draw its outline.
        </p>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <h4>Seeing Shapes</h4>
            <p>
                Try this visualization trick: Squint your eyes slightly or zoom out from your screen. This blurs the details and helps you see the bigger picture - the overall shape rather than individual buildings and streets. What outline emerges?
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Step 2: Identify Boundary Types</h3>
        <p>
            Boundaries come in different forms. Some are created by nature, others by human design. Let's explore what kinds of boundaries might define your island's shape.
        </p>

        <h4>Natural Boundaries</h4>
        <p>These are geographic features created by nature:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Coastlines</strong>: Where land meets ocean, sea, or large lake - the most obvious island boundary</li>
            <li><strong>Rivers</strong>: Flowing water that creates a natural dividing line</li>
            <li><strong>Mountains or hills</strong>: Elevated terrain that creates a barrier</li>
            <li><strong>Forests or wooded areas</strong>: Dense green spaces that separate developed areas</li>
            <li><strong>Cliffs or elevation changes</strong>: Visible as shadows and color changes in satellite view</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Human-Made Boundaries</h4>
        <p>These are borders created by people:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Major highways or roads</strong>: Thick lines that divide neighborhoods</li>
            <li><strong>Railway lines</strong>: Often run parallel and straight, creating clear divisions</li>
            <li><strong>Park boundaries</strong>: The edge where green park space meets urban development</li>
            <li><strong>School grounds or campus edges</strong>: Defined property lines</li>
            <li><strong>Neighborhood borders</strong>: Where one type of development ends and another begins</li>
            <li><strong>Bridges</strong>: Entry and exit points that could mark your island's connections</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="try-it-box">
            <h4>Try It: Boundary Hunt</h4>
            <p>
                Look at your satellite image and identify at least three different boundaries. Write them down. For each one, note whether it's natural or human-made, and whether it creates a clear visual line in the satellite image. The best boundaries are ones you can easily see from space.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Step 3: Choose Your Island's Edge</h3>
        <p>
            Now it's decision time. You need to choose which boundaries will define the edge of your playable game world. You have several options for how to approach this:
        </p>

        <h4>Option A: Natural Island</h4>
        <p>
            If you live near water, you might have an actual island or peninsula in your satellite image. This is the easiest option - the water creates an obvious boundary. Your game world starts at one shore and ends at another.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pros</strong>: Clear, intuitive boundaries; visually striking; easy to understand</li>
            <li><strong>Cons</strong>: Only works if you have water in your area</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Option B: Neighborhood "Island"</h4>
        <p>
            Even without water, you can create an island effect by choosing a defined neighborhood, school campus, or park area. Major roads or different types of land use become your "shores."
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pros</strong>: Works anywhere; lets you focus on a specific familiar area</li>
            <li><strong>Cons</strong>: Requires more creative thinking to make boundaries feel natural</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Option C: Circuit Route</h4>
        <p>
            Choose a circular or loop route through your area. The "island" is everything inside the loop, with major roads or landmarks creating the circular boundary.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pros</strong>: Great for creating running/racing routes; naturally loops back to start</li>
            <li><strong>Cons</strong>: May feel arbitrary if the loop doesn't follow clear geographic features</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Option D: Bounded Rectangle</h4>
        <p>
            Choose four major boundaries (roads, rivers, park edges) that create a rectangular or square area. This is how many cities are actually planned and organized.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pros</strong>: Simple and clear; easy to explain; works in grid-planned cities</li>
            <li><strong>Cons</strong>: Can feel less organic than curved or irregular boundaries</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="decision-box">
            <h4>Making Your Choice</h4>
            <p>
                Ask yourself these questions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>What boundaries are most visible in my satellite image?</li>
                <li>Which boundaries would make sense to a player who doesn't know my local area?</li>
                <li>What shape would create the most interesting gameplay space?</li>
                <li>Which option includes the landmarks I find most interesting?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Step 4: Trace Your Shape</h3>
        <p>
            Now comes the fun part - actually outlining your island's shape. You can do this digitally or on paper, whichever feels more comfortable.
        </p>

        <h4>Digital Tracing Method:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Open your screenshot in any image editing program (Paint, Preview, Photoshop, GIMP, etc.)</li>
            <li>Select a bright, contrasting color (like red or yellow) that will show up clearly</li>
            <li>Use the pencil, pen, or brush tool to draw along the boundaries you've identified</li>
            <li>Don't worry about perfect precision - you're creating a rough outline, not a technical map</li>
            <li>Save this marked-up version with a new filename like "my_island_outline.png"</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Paper Tracing Method:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Print your satellite image (or display it on screen)</li>
            <li>Use a pen or marker to draw the boundary lines</li>
            <li>If your image is on screen, you can even hold up a piece of paper to the screen and trace through it</li>
            <li>Take a photo of your traced outline to save it digitally</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="try-it-box">
            <h4>Try It: Describe Your Shape</h4>
            <p>
                After you've traced your outline, step back and look at it. What does the shape remind you of? Is it a rectangle? A triangle? An irregular blob? A bent line? A circle? Come up with a one-sentence description of your island's shape. For example: "My island is a rounded rectangle with a bite taken out of the eastern side where the river cuts through."
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Step 5: Consider Scale and Proportion</h3>
        <p>
            Now that you have your shape traced, let's think about whether it's the right size for your game.
        </p>

        <h4>Size Sweet Spot</h4>
        <p>
            Your island should be:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Big enough</strong> to include 5+ interesting landmarks (you'll choose these in the next mission)</li>
            <li><strong>Small enough</strong> that you can recognize most locations within it</li>
            <li><strong>Detailed enough</strong> in the satellite image that you can see individual buildings or features</li>
            <li><strong>Coherent enough</strong> that it feels like one connected area, not random scattered points</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            As a rough guide, good island runner maps typically cover an area you could walk across in 15-30 minutes in real life. That might be:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A school campus and surrounding few blocks</li>
            <li>A neighborhood of 15-30 buildings</li>
            <li>A park and adjacent streets</li>
            <li>A small downtown area</li>
            <li>An actual small island (if you're lucky enough to have one nearby!)</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <h4>Too Big or Too Small?</h4>
            <p>
                If your traced shape feels too big (you've outlined your entire city), go back to Google Maps and zoom in to find a smaller, more focused area. If it feels too small (you've just outlined one building), zoom out and include more surrounding area. You want a Goldilocks zone - just right.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Step 6: Name Your Shape</h3>
        <p>
            This might seem silly, but naming your island shape helps you think about it as a distinct game world. Even if you're using your real neighborhood, giving it a creative name helps transition from "the place where I live" to "the world where my game takes place."
        </p>

        <h4>Naming Strategies:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Geographic descriptor</strong>: "Riverside Loop," "Harbor District," "School Campus Circle"</li>
            <li><strong>Shape-based</strong>: "The Triangle," "Crescent Island," "The Square Mile"</li>
            <li><strong>Landmark-based</strong>: "Parkview Territory," "Downtown Dash Zone," "The Academy Grounds"</li>
            <li><strong>Creative/Fantasy</strong>: "Phoenix Island," "Runner's Paradise," "The Challenge Circuit"</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="try-it-box">
            <h4>Try It: Three Name Options</h4>
            <p>
                Come up with three different possible names for your island. Try different naming strategies. Say each name out loud. Which one sounds best? Which one makes you excited to build this game world? You don't have to commit to one name yet, but brainstorming options helps you think creatively about your project.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Understanding Your Shape's Story</h3>
        <p>
            Every shape tells a story about how a place was formed. Is your island stretched along a coastline because that's where ships could dock? Is it a grid because city planners laid it out with efficiency in mind? Is it curved around a river that's been flowing the same path for thousands of years?
        </p>
        <p>
            Understanding why your shape exists helps you understand your local area's history and geography. It also helps you make creative choices later when you're designing your game. Maybe that river becomes a barrier players have to cross. Maybe that highway becomes a dangerous zone to avoid. The real-world shape informs the game-world story.
        </p>

        <div class="inspiration-box">
            <h4>Real-World Connection</h4>
            <p>
                Game designers call this process "level boundaries" or "playable area definition." In open-world games like Zelda or Grand Theft Auto, designers carefully choose where the game world ends. Sometimes it's water (you can't swim any farther). Sometimes it's mountains (too steep to climb). Sometimes it's just invisible barriers. By using real geographic boundaries from your satellite image, you're creating more believable and natural-feeling level boundaries for your island runner.
