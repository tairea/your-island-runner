        <h1>Mission 2.4: Story Your Route</h1>
        <p class="hook-text">
            A race without a purpose is just running in circles. But give that race a story - a treasure hunt, a rescue mission, a festival tour, a challenge from a rival - and suddenly every step matters. The difference between a forgettable game and a memorable one often comes down to one question: Why am I doing this? In this mission, you'll answer that question for your island runner.
        </p>
        <p class="hook-question">
            Why would someone run through your five landmarks? What's the story that connects them? Let's create it.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="mission-objective">
        <h2>Mission Objective</h2>
        <p>
            Create a narrative context and logical route progression that connects your 5 landmarks into a cohesive running journey with clear motivation, sequence, and story arc.
        </p>

        <h2>Understanding Game Narrative</h2>
        <p>
            Story in games doesn't always mean complex plots with dialogue and cutscenes. Sometimes the story is simple: "Race to the finish." "Find all the stars." "Escape before time runs out." Even these simple premises give players motivation and make their actions feel meaningful.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your island runner needs a narrative hook - a reason for the journey. This mission will help you craft that hook and arrange your landmarks into a route that supports your story.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 1: Choose Your Story Type</h3>
        <p>
            Let's start by exploring different narrative frameworks that could work for your island runner. Each type creates different player motivation and suggests different route structures.
        </p>

        <h4>Story Type A: The Tour</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>Premise</strong>: The player is taking a tour of the island's most important or interesting locations.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Examples</strong>: "Welcome to Island - Visit the 5 Wonders," "New Student Orientation Tour," "The Historic Landmarks Trail"
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Best for</strong>: Islands with diverse landmark types that showcase different aspects of your area
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Route logic</strong>: Order landmarks to create a natural touring sequence, perhaps starting with an introduction point and ending at a vista or gathering place
        </p>

        <h4>Story Type B: The Challenge</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>Premise</strong>: Someone has issued a challenge - complete obstacle courses at 5 locations to prove yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Examples</strong>: "The Ultimate Island Challenge," "Parkour Master Trial," "Beat the Island Record"
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Best for</strong>: Islands with athletic spaces (parks, fields, courts) that suggest physical challenges
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Route logic</strong>: Order landmarks by increasing difficulty, or create a circuit that tests different skills at each station
        </p>

        <h4>Story Type C: The Quest</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>Premise</strong>: The player is searching for something, and each landmark provides a clue or piece leading to the next location.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Examples</strong>: "The Island Treasure Hunt," "Solving the Mystery," "Finding the Lost Artifact"
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Best for</strong>: Islands with landmarks that have interesting history or unique characteristics
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Route logic</strong>: Create a sequence where each location logically leads to the next, building toward a climactic final location
        </p>

        <h4>Story Type D: The Race</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>Premise</strong>: A competitive race through checkpoints across the island, possibly against time or other runners.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Examples</strong>: "Island Marathon Challenge," "The Great Race," "Beat the Clock Circuit"
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Best for</strong>: Islands with clear paths between landmarks and good geographic flow
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Route logic</strong>: Minimize backtracking, create efficient paths, consider distance between checkpoints
        </p>

        <h4>Story Type E: The Journey</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>Premise</strong>: The player is traveling from one end of the island to the other, experiencing different neighborhoods or zones along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Examples</strong>: "From Shore to Shore," "East to West Adventure," "The Island Crossing"
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Best for</strong>: Islands with clear geographic progression (coastline to inland, downtown to residential, etc.)
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Route logic</strong>: Start at one edge or corner, end at the opposite, with landmarks distributed along the path between
        </p>

        <h4>Story Type F: The Festival/Event</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>Premise</strong>: There's a special event happening, and participants must visit 5 festival stations across the island.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Examples</strong>: "Island Festival Challenge," "Carnival Circuit," "Community Celebration Run"
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Best for</strong>: Islands with public gathering spaces and community landmarks
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Route logic</strong>: Visit locations in any logical order, or create a circuit that returns to the starting festival grounds
        </p>

        <div class="try-it-box">
            <h4>Try It: Story Brainstorm</h4>
            <p>
                Look at your 5 landmarks. Which story type feels like the most natural fit? Write down 2-3 specific story ideas using different types. For example: "The Historic Downtown Tour" (Type A), "The Parkside Challenge" (Type B), or "The Lost Mascot Mystery" (Type C). Don't commit yet - just brainstorm possibilities.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Step 2: Order Your Landmarks</h3>
        <p>
            Now that you have some story ideas brewing, it's time to decide the order in which players will visit your 5 landmarks. This is your route sequence.
        </p>

        <h4>Choosing Your Start Point (Station 1)</h4>
        <p>
            The first landmark players visit sets the tone for the entire journey. Good starting points are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Welcoming and open</strong>: A park, plaza, or entrance point that feels like a natural beginning</li>
            <li><strong>Clearly defined</strong>: Easy to recognize and locate in the satellite image</li>
            <li><strong>Positioned well</strong>: Located so that it can lead naturally toward other landmarks</li>
            <li><strong>Story-appropriate</strong>: Fits your narrative (a tour starts at an information point, a race starts at a start line, etc.)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Choosing Your End Point (Station 5)</h4>
        <p>
            The final landmark should feel like a destination and provide a sense of completion:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Climactic</strong>: Something special or impressive that feels like an achievement to reach</li>
            <li><strong>Conclusive</strong>: A location that provides natural closure (high point, special building, return to start)</li>
            <li><strong>Memorable</strong>: Players should feel satisfied when they arrive here</li>
            <li><strong>Story-appropriate</strong>: Completes your narrative arc</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Ordering the Middle Stations (2, 3, 4)</h4>
        <p>
            The three middle landmarks create the journey between start and finish. Consider:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Geographic flow</strong>: Does the route make sense on the map, or does it require confusing backtracking?</li>
            <li><strong>Distance variation</strong>: Mix shorter and longer distances between stations to create pacing variety</li>
            <li><strong>Terrain diversity</strong>: If possible, vary the types of landmarks (building, park, field, etc.) as players progress</li>
            <li><strong>Narrative rhythm</strong>: Build tension, provide variety, or create a pattern that supports your story</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <h4>The Route Line Test</h4>
            <p>
                Pull up your satellite image with marked landmarks. Using a different color from your previous markings, draw lines connecting your landmarks in your proposed order: 1→2→3→4→5. Does the route look reasonable? Or does it zigzag all over the place? A good route has clear direction and flow, though some doubling back can add interest.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h4>Common Route Patterns</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Linear</strong>: Straight progression across the island (A → B → C → D → E)</li>
            <li><strong>Circular/Loop</strong>: End point returns to or near start point (creates a circuit)</li>
            <li><strong>Star Pattern</strong>: Hub in center with spokes to outer landmarks</li>
            <li><strong>Spiral</strong>: Gradually work inward or outward from center</li>
            <li><strong>Figure-8 or S-curve</strong>: Weaving pattern across island</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            None of these patterns is inherently better than others - the best pattern is the one that serves your story and makes geographic sense for your specific landmarks.
        </p>

        <div class="try-it-box">
            <h4>Try It: Three Different Routes</h4>
            <p>
                Using your 5 landmarks, create three completely different route sequences. Maybe one goes clockwise around your island, another goes straight across, and a third spirals inward. Draw all three on your map (use different colors or labels). Which route feels best? Which tells the most interesting story? Which flows most naturally?
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Step 3: Develop Your Narrative</h3>
        <p>
            You have your story type and your route order. Now let's flesh out the narrative details that will make your island runner feel purposeful and engaging.
        </p>

        <h4>Create Your Story Hook</h4>
        <p>
            Write a 2-3 sentence "story hook" that explains what the player is doing and why. This is what would appear in your game's introduction or menu screen.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Example hooks:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>"Welcome to Harbor Island! To become an official Island Guide, you must complete the 5-Point Tour, visiting every major landmark and proving your knowledge of our home."</li>
            <li>"The Island Challenge has been issued! Only those who complete obstacle courses at all 5 legendary training grounds can claim the title of Island Champion."</li>
            <li>"The Island Festival trophy has been hidden somewhere on the island. Follow the clues at 5 festival stations to discover its location!"</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="creation-box">
            <h4>Your Story Hook</h4>
            <p>
                Write your story hook now. Remember:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep it simple and clear</li>
                <li>Explain the goal (visit 5 landmarks)</li>
                <li>Provide motivation (why does the player care?)</li>
                <li>Set the tone (adventurous, competitive, exploratory, etc.)</li>
                <li>Use your island's actual characteristics and landmarks</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>Name Each Station</h4>
        <p>
            Beyond just "Landmark 1" or "The Park," give each station a name that ties into your narrative and makes it feel special.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Examples:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>If your story is a challenge: "The Park Parkour Course," "The Library Climb," "The Bridge Sprint"</li>
            <li>If your story is a tour: "Welcome Plaza - The Starting Point," "Historic Library - Culture Stop," "Harbor View - Final Vista"</li>
            <li>If your story is a quest: "First Clue - The Old Oak," "Second Trial - The Stone Bridge," "The Final Answer - Summit Point"</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            These names serve multiple purposes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make each location memorable and distinct</li>
            <li>Reinforce your story theme</li>
            <li>Give you clear labels to use when building in Roblox later</li>
            <li>Help players understand each location's role in the journey</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Write Station Descriptions</h4>
        <p>
            For each of your 5 stations (in route order), write a short description (2-3 sentences) that includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>What the location is in the real world</li>
            <li>What it represents in your game story</li>
            <li>What the player will do there (even if you don't know exactly what obstacle yet)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Example:</strong>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
            <strong>Station 1: Memorial Park - Journey's Beginning</strong><br>
            This peaceful park in the heart of downtown marks the traditional starting point for all Island Challenges. Here, runners warm up with basic parkour training among the old oak trees. Complete the introductory obstacle course to prove you're ready for the journey ahead.
        </p>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <h4>Consistency is Key</h4>
            <p>
                Make sure your station descriptions all support the same story. If Station 1 talks about "ancient island traditions" but Station 3 mentions "modern competitive racing," your narrative feels disjointed. Keep the tone, vocabulary, and premise consistent across all five stations.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Step 4: Map Your Route</h3>
        <p>
            Now let's create the final, definitive route map that shows your complete island runner journey.
        </p>

        <h4>Creating Your Route Map</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Open your satellite image (the one with landmarks marked from Mission 2.3)</li>
            <li>If you experimented with multiple route orders, choose your final sequence now</li>
            <li>Relabel your landmarks with their final route numbers and story names:
                <ul>
                    <li>Station 1: [Story Name]</li>
                    <li>Station 2: [Story Name]</li>
                    <li>Station 3: [Story Name]</li>
                    <li>Station 4: [Story Name]</li>
                    <li>Station 5: [Story Name]</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Draw route lines connecting the stations in sequence: 1→2→2→3→3→4→4→5</li>
            <li>Use arrows to show direction of travel</li>
            <li>Make the route path visually distinct (thick line, bright color, etc.)</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Your final route map should clearly show:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your island boundary from Mission 2.2</li>
            <li>All 5 stations with numbers and names</li>
            <li>The path connecting them in sequence</li>
            <li>Direction arrows showing route flow</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="creation-box">
            <h4>Add a Title and Legend</h4>
            <p>
                Make your map official by adding:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A title at the top: "[Your Island Name] - [Your Story Name]"</li>
                <li>A simple legend explaining what the markings mean</li>
                <li>Your name as the designer</li>
                <li>The date you created it</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This might seem like extra work, but documentation is crucial in game development. Future you (when you're building in Roblox) will appreciate having a clear, labeled map to reference.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Step 5: Consider Travel Between Stations</h3>
        <p>
            Your route isn't just about the stations themselves - it's also about the journey between them. Let's think about what players experience while traveling from station to station.
        </p>

        <h4>Distance and Pacing</h4>
        <p>
            Look at your route map. Estimate the distance between each pair of consecutive stations:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Station 1 → Station 2: [Short/Medium/Long distance]</li>
            <li>Station 2 → Station 3: [Short/Medium/Long distance]</li>
            <li>Station 3 → Station 4: [Short/Medium/Long distance]</li>
            <li>Station 4 → Station 5: [Short/Medium/Long distance]</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Ideally, you want variety in these distances. A route where every segment is exactly the same length can feel monotonous. Mix it up when possible.
        </p>

        <h4>Terrain and Obstacles</h4>
        <p>
            What lies between your stations? Look at your satellite image along each route segment:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Are there roads to cross?</li>
            <li>Open parks to run through?</li>
            <li>Buildings to navigate around?</li>
            <li>Water to potentially bridge?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            These environmental features will become part of your game world later. For now, just note them. They'll influence how you build your island in Roblox Studio.
        </p>

        <div class="try-it-box">
            <h4>Try It: Imagine the Journey</h4>
            <p>
                Close your eyes and imagine actually running your route in real life. Start at Station 1. What do you see as you travel to Station 2? What landmarks pass by? What does the environment change to? Walk through the entire route mentally, noting interesting features along the way. These observations will enrich your later building work.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Step 6: Compile Your Design Document</h3>
        <p>
            You've done tremendous planning work. Now let's organize it all into a clear design document that you'll reference throughout the building phase.
        </p>

        <h4>Your Island Runner Design Document</h4>
        <p>
            Create a document (digital or paper) with the following sections:
        </p>

        <h5>1. Project Overview</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Island name</li>

            <li>Design date</li>
            <li>Your name as designer</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>2. Island Map</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Your complete satellite image showing boundary, stations, and route</li>

            <li>Why you chose this location</li>
            <li>Initial obstacle ideas (even if vague)</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>4. Route Notes</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Total number of stations: 5</li>

        <h5>5. Future Ideas</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Potential obstacles for each station</li>
            <li>Environmental details you want to include</li>
            <li>Extra landmarks for possible future expansion</li>
            <li>Any other creative ideas that came up during planning</li>
        </ul>

            <h4>Save Everything</h4>
            <p>
                Your design document is your game's blueprint. Save it somewhere safe and accessible. When you start building in Roblox Studio (in the next Star), this document will guide every decision you make. Professional game developers create documents like this for every project - you're learning real industry practice.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>The Power of Story in Games</h3>
        <p>
            Why does story matter so much in a game about running and obstacles? Because story creates meaning. Without a story, your island runner is just "go to these five places." With a story, it becomes "complete the Island Challenge" or "discover the hidden treasure" or "explore your hometown's wonders."
        </p>

        <p>
            Story also helps you make design decisions. When you're building in Roblox later and you're not sure what color to make something or which obstacle fits better, you can ask: "What serves the story?" The story becomes your guide.
        </p>

        <p>
            Even simple stories create player investment. When players understand why they're running through your island, they care about completing the journey. And when players care, they remember the experience.
        </p>

        <div class="inspiration-box">
            <h4>Real-World Connection</h4>
            <p>
                Narrative designers in game companies do exactly what you just did: they create story frameworks that give players motivation and direction. They sequence levels to create story arcs. They name locations to reinforce themes. They write descriptions that make players care about virtual places. The design document you created is the same kind of document that professionals use to communicate vision and keep development teams aligned. You've just completed genuine narrative design work.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Celebrate Your Planning</h3>
        <p>
            You've completed all four missions in the Island Vision star. Look at what you've accomplished:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Captured satellite imagery of your real local area</li>
            <li>Identified the distinctive shape of your island territory</li>
            <li>Selected 5 meaningful landmarks for obstacle stations</li>
            <li>Created a story that connects them into a purposeful journey</li>
            <li>Designed a complete route with clear sequence and flow</li>
            <li>Documented everything in a professional design document</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This is no small feat. Many game projects fail because developers skip the planning phase and jump straight to building. You've done the smart thing: you've researched, designed, and documented before touching any building tools. This foundation will make the actual construction process smoother, faster, and more focused.
        </p>

        <p>
            Take a moment to appreciate your design. Share it with friends, family, or classmates if you want. Show them your route map and explain your story. Their reactions will tell you if your narrative is clear and compelling.
        </p>

        <p>
            And get excited - because in the next star, you'll start bringing this plan to life in Roblox Studio.

        <h2>Mission Check</h2>
        <p>Before you complete this mission, verify you have:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reviewed all story type options and chosen one that fits your island</li>
            <li>Selected a starting landmark (Station 1) with clear justification</li>
            <li>Selected an ending landmark (Station 5) that provides closure</li>
            <li>Ordered all 5 landmarks into a logical route sequence</li>
            <li>Drawn the complete route on your satellite map with directional arrows</li>
            <li>Created a story hook (2-3 sentences) explaining the premise</li>
            <li>Given each station a story-appropriate name</li>
            <li>Written a description for each station explaining its role</li>
            <li>Verified your route makes geographic sense and flows well</li>
            <li>Compiled a complete design document with all planning elements</li>
            <li>Saved your final route map with title, legend, and labels</li>
            <li>Noted interesting environmental features along your route</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="mission-bridge">
        <h2>Congratulations - Star 2 Complete!</h2>
        <p>
            You've finished Island Vision! You've researched your local area from a satellite perspective, identified meaningful locations, and crafted them into a story-driven route. Your island runner exists now as a complete design - it just needs to be built.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Next Star: World Building Round 1</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            In the next star, you'll open Roblox Studio and begin the actual construction process. You'll import your satellite image as a reference, create the basic terrain and shape of your island, and start placing the foundations for your 5 stations. Your research and planning are about to become a playable 3D world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before moving on, make sure you have:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your satellite image saved and accessible</li>
            <li>Your route map with all 5 stations labeled</li>
            <li>Your design document completed</li>
            <li>Roblox Studio installed and ready</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Take a break, celebrate your planning work, and get ready to build. The real fun is about to begin!
