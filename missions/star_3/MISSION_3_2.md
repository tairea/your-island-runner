# Mission 3.2: Terrain Foundations

**Learning Objective**: Use parts or terrain tools to create the rough shape of your island based on your satellite reference image

## Summary
Build the foundational landmass of your island by matching the shape you see in your reference decal. Learn to work with either basic parts or Roblox terrain tools to create the rough outline and elevation of your island world.

## Key Concepts
- Translating 2D reference to 3D form
- Part-based terrain building
- Roblox terrain tools (generate and sculpting)
- Working with scale and proportion
- Iterative building workflow

## Prerequisites
- Completed Mission 3.1 (Reference Image Setup)
- Understanding of part manipulation (move, scale, rotate)
- Basic navigation in 3D workspace
