# Mission 6.2: Skybox Selection

**Learning Objective**: Choose and apply a skybox texture that complements the island theme and lighting configuration

## Summary
The sky surrounds your entire game world and sets the backdrop for your island runner. In this mission, you'll replace Roblox's default sky with a custom skybox that matches your location—whether that's tropical blue skies, mountain horizons, desert sunsets, or urban skylines.

## Key Concepts
- Skyboxes are cube-mapped textures that create the illusion of a surrounding environment
- The Sky object in Lighting controls which textures are displayed
- Skybox choice should align with time of day, location theme, and lighting settings
- Roblox Asset Library and Creator Marketplace provide free skybox options
- Custom skyboxes can be uploaded as six separate texture files

## Prerequisites
- Completed Mission 6.1 (Lighting and Atmosphere configured)
- Understanding of asset insertion from Toolbox/Creator Marketplace
- Ability to search and evaluate visual assets
