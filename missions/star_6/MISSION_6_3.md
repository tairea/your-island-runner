# Mission 6.3: Detail Parts

**Learning Objective**: Add small decorative elements that reference the real-world location to enhance specificity and immersion

## Summary
Detail parts are the small decorative elements that make your island feel like a real place rather than a game prototype. In this mission, you'll add location-specific props, decorations, and environmental details that reference your actual location—signs, plants, rocks, cultural objects, or architectural features that tell players "this is not just any island, this is [your place]."

## Key Concepts
- Environmental storytelling through small details
- Decorative parts vs. gameplay parts (details should not interfere with running/jumping)
- Strategic placement to enhance zones without cluttering
- Using the Toolbox to find themed props and models
- Anchoring and positioning decorative elements
- Balance between visual richness and performance

## Prerequisites
- Completed Mission 6.2 (Skybox applied)
- Understanding of how to insert and position parts/models
- Ability to use the Toolbox to search for assets
- Awareness of Anchored property to prevent physics interactions
