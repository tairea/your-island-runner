# Mission 6.4: Sound Atmosphere

**Learning Objective**: Implement ambient audio using Sound objects to enhance environmental immersion and location authenticity

## Summary
Sound completes the sensory experience of your island runner. In this mission, you'll add ambient audio—background environmental sounds like ocean waves, forest birds, desert wind, or city traffic—that makes your location feel alive and authentic. You'll learn to use Roblox Sound objects, configure looping and volume, and layer multiple sounds to create a rich soundscape.

## Key Concepts
- Sound objects play audio files in the game world
- Ambient sounds should loop continuously to create environmental atmosphere
- Volume and RollOffMode control how sound behaves with distance
- Layering multiple sounds creates depth and realism
- Audio Library provides free sound effects for common environments
- Sound placement affects whether audio is global or positional

## Prerequisites
- Completed Mission 6.3 (Detail parts added to all zones)
- Understanding of Explorer hierarchy and property editing
- Ability to search and use the Toolbox/Asset Library
- Basic awareness of audio concepts (volume, looping)
