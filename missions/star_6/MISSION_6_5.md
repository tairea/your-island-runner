# Mission 6.5: Difficulty Tuning

**Learning Objective**: Adjust obstacle spacing, timing, and difficulty progression based on structured playtest feedback to optimize game feel

## Summary
A game can look beautiful and sound immersive, but if it's too hard, too easy, or frustratingly inconsistent, players won't enjoy it. In this final polish mission, you'll conduct structured playtests, gather specific feedback on difficulty, and make targeted adjustments to obstacle spacing, jump timing, and progression curves. You'll learn to balance challenge and accessibility so your island runner feels fair, engaging, and fun.

## Key Concepts
- Difficulty curve should gradually increase from Zone 1 to Zone 5
- Playtesting reveals problems that developers can't see (you know the course too well)
- Feedback should be specific and actionable, not just "it's hard"
- Common adjustments: platform spacing, obstacle speed, checkpoint placement, visual clarity
- "Game feel" emerges from dozens of small tuning decisions
- Iteration is essential—test, adjust, test again

## Prerequisites
- Completed Mission 6.4 (Sound atmosphere added)
- All five zones fully built with obstacles and landmarks
- Ability to adjust Part properties (Size, Position, Speed for moving obstacles)
- Willingness to watch others play and accept critical feedback
