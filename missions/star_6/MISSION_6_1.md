# Mission 6.1: Lighting and Atmosphere

**Learning Objective**: Configure Lighting service properties to establish mood and time of day that enhances the island theme

## Summary
Lighting transforms how your island runner feels. In this mission, you'll use the Lighting service to set time of day, adjust fog, and create atmospheric effects that match your location's real-world character—whether that's bright tropical sunshine, misty morning mountains, or golden hour coastlines.

## Key Concepts
- Lighting service controls global illumination and atmosphere
- ClockTime property sets the sun position (0-24 hour format)
- Ambient and OutdoorAmbient affect shadow colors and overall tone
- Fog properties create depth and atmosphere
- Environmental effects support immersion and theme

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of basic property editing in Explorer
