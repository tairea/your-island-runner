From up here, everything looks different. Your school becomes a tiny rectangle. The park where you hang out transforms into a patch of green. Roads become thin lines connecting it all together.

Before you can build your island runner in Roblox, you need to study the real geography you're recreating. Google Maps satellite view gives you access to the same technology that helps pilots navigate, urban planners design cities, and yes, game developers create realistic environments.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3>Step 1: Launch Your Satellite View</h3>\n        <p>\n            Open your web browser and navigate to <strong>maps.google.com</strong>. You'll see the familiar map interface with roads, labels, and colored regions. But we're going to switch to something much cooler.\n        </p>\n        <ol>\n            <li>Look for the <strong>Layers</strong> button in the bottom-left corner of the map</li>\n            <li>Click on it and select <strong>Satellite</strong> from the menu</li>\n            <li>Watch your map transform from a diagram into a photograph taken from space</li>\n        </ol>\n\n        <div class=\"try-it-box\">\n            <h4>Try It: First Impressions</h4>\n            <p>\n                When you first switch to satellite view, take a moment to explore wherever the map is currently showing. Notice how buildings cast shadows. See how you can tell the difference between grass, concrete, and water just by color and texture. This is real photography captured by satellites orbiting Earth.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h3>Step 2: Navigate to Your Territory</h3>\n        <p>\n            Now it's time to find your local area. You have several options for getting there:\n        </p>\n\n        <h4>Option A: Use the Search Bar</h4>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Click the search bar at the top of the screen</li>\n            <li>Type your school address, your home address, or a well-known landmark near you</li>\n            <li>Press Enter and watch Google Maps fly you to that location</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <h4>Option B: Use Your Location</h4>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Look for the small circular button with a target/crosshair icon (usually on the right side)</li>\n            <li>Click it to center the map on your current location</li>\n            <li>You may need to give your browser permission to access your location</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <h4>Option C: Manual Navigation</h4>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Click and drag the map to pan around</li>\n            <li>Use the + and - buttons to zoom in and out</li>\n            <li>Navigate your way to your local area like a true explorer</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <div class=\"tip-box\">\n            <h4>Navigation Tip</h4>\n            <p>\n                You can also use your mouse wheel or trackpad to zoom in and out. Scroll up to zoom in, scroll down to zoom out. This is much faster than clicking the + and - buttons once you get the hang of it.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h3>Step 3: Find the Perfect View</h3>\n        <p>\n            Now comes the fun part: finding the absolute best satellite view of your area. This isn't just about zooming in randomly. You're looking for a view that tells a story and gives you interesting geography to work with.\n        </p>\n\n        <h4>What Makes a Great View?</h4>\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>Clear boundaries</strong>: Can you see where your neighborhood ends? Is there a coastline, a river, a major road, or a park that creates a natural border?</li>\n            <li><strong>Interesting landmarks</strong>: Do you see recognizable buildings, parks, sports fields, or unique features?</li>\n            <li><strong>Variety of terrain</strong>: The best game maps have different types of areas - maybe you have buildings, green spaces, water, and roads all visible</li>\n            <li><strong>Good scale</strong>: Zoom to a level where you can see details but also get a sense of the whole area. Too close and you'll only see one building; too far and everything becomes a blur</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <div class=\"try-it-box\">\n            <h4>Try It: The Goldilocks Zoom</h4>\n            <p>\n                Zoom all the way out until your entire town is just a small dot. Now zoom all the way in until you can see individual cars in a parking lot. The perfect zoom level is somewhere in between - where you can see about 10-20 buildings or city blocks at once. This gives you enough detail to plan with, while showing how everything connects together.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h4>Adjust Your Perspective</h4>\n        <p>\n            Google Maps lets you do more than just zoom. Try these advanced controls:\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>Tilt view</strong>: Hold Shift and drag the mouse to tilt the view and see buildings from an angle (works best in urban areas)</li>\n            <li><strong>Rotate</strong>: Hold Ctrl (or Cmd on Mac) and drag to rotate the map to face a different direction</li>\n            <li><strong>Street View</strong>: Drag the little yellow person icon onto any blue-highlighted road to see a ground-level photo view</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>\n            For your island runner, you'll want a straight-down overhead view (the default), but it's worth experimenting with these controls to see your area from every angle.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3>Step 4: Capture Your Satellite Image</h3>\n        <p>\n            Once you've found the perfect view, it's time to save it.

In your island runner, players need to know where they can and can't go. The best boundaries feel natural and make sense in the context of your world. You don't want arbitrary invisible walls - you want logical borders that players understand intuitively.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3>Step 1: Open Your Satellite Image</h3>\n        <p>\n            Pull up the screenshot you saved from Mission 2.1. Look at it not as a map of places you know, but as a shape puzzle. Imagine you're looking at an island from an airplane, and you need to draw its outline.\n        </p>\n\n        <div class=\"tip-box\">\n            <h4>Seeing Shapes</h4>\n            <p>\n                Try this visualization trick: Squint your eyes slightly or zoom out from your screen. This blurs the details and helps you see the bigger picture - the overall shape rather than individual buildings and streets. What outline emerges?\n            </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h3>Step 2: Identify Boundary Types</h3>\n        <p>\n            Boundaries come in different forms. Some are created by nature, others by human design. Let's explore what kinds of boundaries might define your island's shape.\n        </p>\n\n        <h4>Natural Boundaries</h4>\n        <p>These are geographic features created by nature:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>Coastlines</strong>: Where land meets ocean, sea, or large lake - the most obvious island boundary</li>\n            <li><strong>Rivers</strong>: Flowing water that creates a natural dividing line</li>\n            <li><strong>Mountains or hills</strong>: Elevated terrain that creates a barrier</li>\n            <li><strong>Forests or wooded areas</strong>: Dense green spaces that separate developed areas</li>\n            <li><strong>Cliffs or elevation changes</strong>: Visible as shadows and color changes in satellite view</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <h4>Human-Made Boundaries</h4>\n        <p>These are borders created by people:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>Major highways or roads</strong>: Thick lines that divide neighborhoods</li>\n            <li><strong>Railway lines</strong>: Often run parallel and straight, creating clear divisions</li>\n            <li><strong>Park boundaries</strong>: The edge where green park space meets urban development</li>\n            <li><strong>School grounds or campus edges</strong>: Defined property lines</li>\n            <li><strong>Neighborhood borders</strong>: Where one type of development ends and another begins</li>\n            <li><strong>Bridges</strong>: Entry and exit points that could mark your island's connections</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <div class=\"try-it-box\">\n            <h4>Try It: Boundary Hunt</h4>\n            <p>\n                Look at your satellite image and identify at least three different boundaries. Write them down. For each one, note whether it's natural or human-made, and whether it creates a clear visual line in the satellite image. The best boundaries are ones you can easily see from space.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h3>Step 3: Choose Your Island's Edge</h3>\n        <p>\n            Now it's decision time. You need to choose which boundaries will define the edge of your playable game world. You have several options for how to approach this:\n        </p>\n\n        <h4>Option A: Natural Island</h4>\n        <p>\n            If you live near water, you might have an actual island or peninsula in your satellite image. This is the easiest option - the water creates an obvious boundary. Your game world starts at one shore and ends at another.\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>Pros</strong>: Clear, intuitive boundaries; visually striking; easy to understand</li>\n            <li><strong>Cons</strong>: Only works if you have water in your area</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <h4>Option B: Neighborhood \"Island\"</h4>\n        <p>\n            Even without water, you can create an island effect by choosing a defined neighborhood, school campus, or park area. Major roads or different types of land use become your \"shores.\"\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>Pros</strong>: Works anywhere; lets you focus on a specific familiar area</li>\n            <li><strong>Cons</strong>: Requires more creative thinking to make boundaries feel natural</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <h4>Option C: Circuit Route</h4>\n        <p>\n            Choose a circular or loop route through your area. The \"island\" is everything inside the loop, with major roads or landmarks creating the circular boundary.\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>Pros</strong>: Great for creating running/racing routes; naturally loops back to start</li>\n            <li><strong>Cons</strong>: May feel arbitrary if the loop doesn't follow clear geographic features</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <h4>Option D: Bounded Rectangle</h4>\n        <p>\n            Choose four major boundaries (roads, rivers, park edges) that create a rectangular or square area. This is how many cities are actually planned and organized.\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>Pros</strong>: Simple and clear; easy to explain; works in grid-planned cities</li>\n            <li><strong>Cons</strong>: Can feel less organic than curved or irregular boundaries</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <div class=\"decision-box\">\n            <h4>Making Your Choice</h4>\n            <p>\n                Ask yourself these questions:\n            </p>\n            <ul>\n                <li>What boundaries are most visible in my satellite image?</li>\n                <li>Which boundaries would make sense to a player who doesn't know my local area?</li>\n                <li>What shape would create the most interesting gameplay space?</li>\n                <li>Which option includes the landmarks I find most interesting?</li>\n            </ul>\n        </div>\n\n        <h3>Step 4: Trace Your Shape</h3>\n        <p>\n            Now comes the fun part - actually outlining your island's shape. You can do this digitally or on paper, whichever feels more comfortable.\n        </p>\n\n        <h4>Digital Tracing Method:</h4>\n        <ol>\n            <li>Open your screenshot in any image editing program (Paint, Preview, Photoshop, GIMP, etc.)</li>\n            <li>Select a bright, contrasting color (like red or yellow) that will show up clearly</li>\n            <li>Use the pencil, pen, or brush tool to draw along the boundaries you've identified</li>\n            <li>Don't worry about perfect precision - you're creating a rough outline, not a technical map</li>\n            <li>Save this marked-up version with a new filename like \"my_island_outline.png\"</li>\n        </ol>\n\n        <h4>Paper Tracing Method:</h4>\n        <ol>\n            <li>Print your satellite image (or display it on screen)</li>\n            <li>Use a pen or marker to draw the boundary lines</li>\n            <li>If your image is on screen, you can even hold up a piece of paper to the screen and trace through it</li>\n            <li>Take a photo of your traced outline to save it digitally</li>\n        </ol>\n\n        <div class=\"try-it-box\">\n            <h4>Try It: Describe Your Shape</h4>\n            <p>\n                After you've traced your outline, step back and look at it. What does the shape remind you of? Is it a rectangle? A triangle? An irregular blob? A bent line? A circle? Come up with a one-sentence description of your island's shape. For example: \"My island is a rounded rectangle with a bite taken out of the eastern side where the river cuts through.\"\n            </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h3>Step 5: Consider Scale and Proportion</h3>\n        <p>\n            Now that you have your shape traced, let's think about whether it's the right size for your game.\n        </p>\n\n        <h4>Size Sweet Spot</h4>\n        <p>\n            Your island should be:\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>Big enough</strong> to include 5+ interesting landmarks (you'll choose these in the next mission)</li>\n            <li><strong>Small enough</strong> that you can recognize most locations within it</li>\n            <li><strong>Detailed enough</strong> in the satellite image that you can see individual buildings or features</li>\n            <li><strong>Coherent enough</strong> that it feels like one connected area, not random scattered points</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>\n            As a rough guide, good island runner maps typically cover an area you could walk across in 15-30 minutes in real life. That might be:\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>A school campus and surrounding few blocks</li>\n            <li>A neighborhood of 15-30 buildings</li>\n            <li>A park and adjacent streets</li>\n            <li>A small downtown area</li>\n            <li>An actual small island (if you're lucky enough to have one nearby!)</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <div class=\"tip-box\">\n            <h4>Too Big or Too Small?</h4>\n            <p>\n                If your traced shape feels too big (you've outlined your entire city), go back to Google Maps and zoom in to find a smaller, more focused area. If it feels too small (you've just outlined one building), zoom out and include more surrounding area. You want a Goldilocks zone - just right.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h3>Step 6: Name Your Shape</h3>\n        <p>\n            This might seem silly, but naming your island shape helps you think about it as a distinct game world. Even if you're using your real neighborhood, giving it a creative name helps transition from \"the place where I live\" to \"the world where my game takes place.\"\n        </p>\n\n        <h4>Naming Strategies:</h4>\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>Geographic descriptor</strong>: \"Riverside Loop,\" \"Harbor District,\" \"School Campus Circle\"</li>\n            <li><strong>Shape-based</strong>: \"The Triangle,\" \"Crescent Island,\" \"The Square Mile\"</li>\n            <li><strong>Landmark-based</strong>: \"Parkview Territory,\" \"Downtown Dash Zone,\" \"The Academy Grounds\"</li>\n            <li><strong>Creative/Fantasy</strong>: \"Phoenix Island,\" \"Runner's Paradise,\" \"The Challenge Circuit\"</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <div class=\"try-it-box\">\n            <h4>Try It: Three Name Options</h4>\n            <p>\n                Come up with three different possible names for your island. Try different naming strategies. Say each name out loud. Which one sounds best? Which one makes you excited to build this game world? You don't have to commit to one name yet, but brainstorming options helps you think creatively about your project.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h3>Understanding Your Shape's Story</h3>\n        <p>\n            Every shape tells a story about how a place was formed. Is your island stretched along a coastline because that's where ships could dock? Is it a grid because city planners laid it out with efficiency in mind? Is it curved around a river that's been flowing the same path for thousands of years?\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Understanding why your shape exists helps you understand your local area's history and geography. It also helps you make creative choices later when you're designing your game. Maybe that river becomes a barrier players have to cross. Maybe that highway becomes a dangerous zone to avoid. The real-world shape informs the game-world story.\n        </p>\n\n        <div class=\"inspiration-box\">\n            <h4>Real-World Connection</h4>\n            <p>\n                Game designers call this process \"level boundaries\" or \"playable area definition.\" In open-world games like Zelda or Grand Theft Auto, designers carefully choose where the game world ends. Sometimes it's water (you can't swim any farther). Sometimes it's mountains (too steep to climb). Sometimes it's just invisible barriers. By using real geographic boundaries from your satellite image, you're creating more believable and natural-feeling level boundaries for your island runner.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"mission-check\">\n        <h2>Mission Check</h2>\n        <p>Before you complete this mission, verify you have:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Examined your satellite image to identify visible boundaries</li>\n            <li>Identified at least 3 different boundary types (natural or human-made)</li>\n            <li>Chosen which boundaries will define your island's edges</li>\n            <li>Traced the outline of your island shape (digitally or on paper)</li>\n            <li>Saved your traced outline image or drawing</li>\n            <li>Described your island's overall shape in a sentence</li>\n            <li>Verified your island is the right size (5+ landmarks possible)</li>\n            <li>Brainstormed at least one name for your island territory</li>\n        </ul>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"mission-bridge\">\n        <h2>Next Mission: Landmark Hunt</h2>\n        <p>\n            You've defined your island's boundaries.

Each station needs to:\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Be recognizable in the satellite image</li>\n            <li>Be visually distinctive from other stations</li>\n            <li>Inspire ideas for what kind of obstacle could go there</li>\n            <li>Fit logically into your island's overall geography</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <h3>Step 1: Study Your Island</h3>\n        <p>\n            Pull up your satellite image with the traced boundary outline from Mission 2.2. You're going to study every detail of what's inside those boundaries, looking for standout locations.\n        </p>\n\n        <div class=\"tip-box\">\n            <h4>Switch Perspectives</h4>\n            <p>\n                Look at your satellite image in Google Maps, but also toggle between Satellite view and regular Map view. The map view shows building labels, street names, and points of interest that might not be obvious from the satellite photo alone. A building that looks ordinary from above might be labeled as \"Community Center\" or \"Historic Library\" - instant landmark potential!\n            </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h3>Step 2: Landmark Categories</h3>\n        <p>\n            Good obstacle stations come in many forms. Let's explore the types of landmarks you might find in your island, along with what makes each type special for game design.\n        </p>\n\n        <h4>Buildings & Structures</h4>\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>Schools</strong>: Large, rectangular, usually with sports fields - excellent for central hub stations</li>\n            <li><strong>Churches/Temples</strong>: Distinctive architecture, often with towers or unique shapes</li>\n            <li><strong>Libraries or Community Centers</strong>: Public buildings with cultural significance</li>\n            <li><strong>Shopping Centers or Markets</strong>: Large footprints, lots of activity, busy zones</li>\n            <li><strong>Stadiums or Arenas</strong>: Circular or oval shapes, massive scale</li>\n            <li><strong>Unique Buildings</strong>: Anything with unusual shape, color, or historical significance</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <h4>Outdoor Spaces</h4>\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>Parks</strong>: Green spaces visible from satellite, natural gathering places</li>\n            <li><strong>Playgrounds</strong>: Small but distinctive, often with equipment visible from above</li>\n            <li><strong>Sports Fields</strong>: Soccer fields, baseball diamonds, basketball courts - geometric and colorful</li>\n            <li><strong>Plazas or Squares</strong>: Open urban spaces, often at intersections</li>\n            <li><strong>Gardens or Green Spaces</strong>: Areas with distinctive landscaping patterns</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <h4>Transportation & Infrastructure</h4>\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>Bridges</strong>: Dramatic crossing points over water or roads</li>\n            <li><strong>Train or Bus Stations</strong>: Transit hubs where people gather</li>\n            <li><strong>Parking Lots</strong>: Large paved areas (could become challenge arenas)</li>\n            <li><strong>Roundabouts or Traffic Circles</strong>: Distinctive circular patterns</li>\n            <li><strong>Harbors or Docks</strong>: Water-land interfaces with boats and piers</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <h4>Natural Features</h4>\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>Beaches or Shorelines</strong>: Where land meets water</li>\n            <li><strong>Hills or Elevated Points</strong>: Visible as terrain variation and shadows</li>\n            <li><strong>Rivers or Streams</strong>: Flowing water creating linear features</li>\n            <li><strong>Wooded Areas</strong>: Clusters of trees, darker green patches</li>\n            <li><strong>Ponds or Lakes</strong>: Small bodies of water within your island</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <div class=\"try-it-box\">\n            <h4>Try It: Category Scout</h4>\n            <p>\n                Set a timer for 5 minutes. During this time, identify as many potential landmarks as you can in your island, organizing them by category. Don't judge or filter yet - just find and list everything you can see. Try to find at least 10-15 possibilities. This gives you plenty of options to choose from in the next steps.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h3>Step 3: Selection Criteria</h3>\n        <p>\n            You probably found more than 5 potential landmarks. Now comes the hard part: choosing which ones make the final cut. Use these criteria to evaluate each candidate:\n        </p>\n\n        <h4>1. Visual Distinctiveness</h4>\n        <p>\n            Can you clearly see and identify this landmark in the satellite image? The best landmarks have:\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Unique shapes (circles, triangles, unusual geometry)</li>\n            <li>Different colors than surroundings (green park vs. gray buildings)</li>\n            <li>Distinctive patterns (sports field lines, parking lot rows)</li>\n            <li>Notable size (much bigger or smaller than nearby structures)</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <h4>2. Personal Connection</h4>\n        <p>\n            Do you have a relationship with this place? The best landmarks are ones you know:\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Places you visit regularly</li>\n            <li>Locations with memories or stories attached</li>\n            <li>Spots your friends would recognize</li>\n            <li>Landmarks that mean something to your community</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <h4>3. Obstacle Potential</h4>\n        <p>\n            Can you imagine what kind of obstacle course could exist here? Think about:\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>What the space offers (open area, vertical structure, water nearby?)</li>\n            <li>What activities happen here in real life</li>\n            <li>What challenges fit the location's character</li>\n            <li>How the real-world function could inspire game mechanics</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <h4>4. Spatial Distribution</h4>\n        <p>\n            Where is this landmark relative to others? Good station placement means:\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Stations spread across your island, not all clustered together</li>\n            <li>Roughly even distances between consecutive stations</li>\n            <li>Coverage of different areas and terrain types</li>\n            <li>Natural flow from one station to the next</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <div class=\"decision-box\">\n            <h4>The Magic Number: Why 5?</h4>\n            <p>\n                Five stations is the sweet spot for your first island runner. It's enough to create a real journey with variety, but not so many that you'll spend forever building. Five stations also creates good pacing - start, three middle challenges, and a finale. As you gain experience, you can always add more stations later, but start with five to keep your project manageable and achievable.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h3>Step 4: The Selection Process</h3>\n        <p>\n            Now let's systematically narrow down your list of potential landmarks to the final five.\n        </p>\n\n        <h4>Round 1: Must-Haves</h4>\n        <p>\n            Look at your list of potential landmarks. Are there any that are absolute must-haves? These might be:\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>The most iconic or recognizable landmark in your area</li>\n            <li>A place with deep personal significance</li>\n            <li>The most visually striking feature in your satellite image</li>\n            <li>A location that perfectly captures what your island is about</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>\n            Mark 1-2 landmarks as definite selections. These are your anchors - the rest of your stations will be chosen to work well with these.\n        </p>\n\n        <h4>Round 2: Spatial Balance</h4>\n        <p>\n            Open an image editor or grab a pen and your printed satellite image. Mark the locations of your must-have landmarks. Now divide your island into rough zones (north/south/east/west, or quadrants, or however makes sense for your shape).\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Look for landmarks that fill in the gaps:\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>If your must-haves are in the north, choose stations in the south</li>\n            <li>If you have east and west covered, find something central</li>\n            <li>Aim for a distribution where stations feel spread out, not clumped</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <h4>Round 3: Variety Check</h4>\n        <p>\n            Look at the landmarks you've selected so far. Do you have variety in types? Ideally, your five stations should include different categories:\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Mix buildings with outdoor spaces</li>\n            <li>Include both large and small landmarks</li>\n            <li>Combine natural features with human-made structures</li>\n            <li>Balance public spaces with distinctive architecture</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>\n            Variety keeps your game interesting and showcases different aspects of your island.\n        </p>\n\n        <h4>Round 4: Final Picks</h4>\n        <p>\n            If you're down to exactly 5 landmarks, great! If you still have more, make your final cuts based on:\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Which ones you're most excited to build</li>\n            <li>Which ones create the best route flow (we'll explore this in Mission 2.4)</li>\n            <li>Which ones you can most clearly see in your satellite image</li>\n            <li>Which ones feel most essential to representing your island</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <div class=\"try-it-box\">\n            <h4>Try It: The Elevator Pitch</h4>\n            <p>\n                For each of your 5 selected landmarks, write a one-sentence description that captures what makes it special. For example: \"The old brick library with the copper dome where the city was founded.\" Or: \"The basketball court behind the school where everyone plays after class.\" These sentences help you articulate why each landmark deserves its spot in your game.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h3>Step 5: Mark Your Stations</h3>\n        <p>\n            Now make your selections visible and concrete.\n        </p>\n\n        <h4>Digital Marking Method:</h4>\n        <ol>\n            <li>Open your satellite image with the traced boundary in an image editor</li>\n            <li>Choose a bright, easily visible color (different from your boundary line)</li>\n            <li>Place numbered markers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) at each landmark location</li>\n            <li>The numbers don't have to represent route order yet - just label them for reference</li>\n            <li>Make the markers big enough to see clearly</li>\n            <li>Save this version as \"my_island_landmarks.png\" or similar</li>\n        </ol>\n\n        <h4>Paper Marking Method:</h4>\n        <ol>\n            <li>Print your satellite image or use your previously marked version</li>\n            <li>Use stickers, stars, or numbered circles to mark each landmark</li>\n            <li>Write the landmark name next to each marker</li>\n            <li>Take a photo of the marked-up map to save it digitally</li>\n        </ol>\n\n        <div class=\"tip-box\">\n            <h4>Backup Choices</h4>\n            <p>\n                Keep your list of runner-up landmarks somewhere safe. If you discover later that one of your five stations doesn't work well (maybe it's too close to another, or you can't think of a good obstacle for it), you'll want backup options ready to swap in. Don't delete that brainstorming list!\n            </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h3>Step 6: Create Your Landmark Registry</h3>\n        <p>\n            Professional game designers keep detailed documentation of all important locations in their game worlds. Let's create a simple registry for your landmarks.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n            Open a text document, note-taking app, or piece of paper and create entries for each landmark with this information:\n        </p>\n\n        <h4>Landmark Registry Template:</h4>\n        <pre>\nLANDMARK #1: [Name]\nType: [Building/Outdoor Space/Natural Feature/Infrastructure]\nDescription: [One sentence capturing what it is]\nWhy I chose it: [Personal connection or visual appeal]\nSatellite characteristics: [What makes it visible from above]\nObstacle ideas: [Initial thoughts - can be vague for now]\n\nLANDMARK #2: [Name]\n[Repeat for all 5 landmarks]\n        </pre>\n\n        <p>\n            This registry serves multiple purposes:\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Documents your design decisions</li>\n            <li>Helps you remember why you chose each location</li>\n            <li>Creates a reference guide for when you start building</li>\n            <li>Gives you a place to brainstorm obstacle ideas</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <div class=\"try-it-box\">\n            <h4>Try It: Stranger's Perspective</h4>\n            <p>\n                Imagine someone who has never visited your island is looking at your satellite image with the 5 landmarks marked. Based only on what they can see from above, would they understand why you chose each landmark? If not, think about what makes each location special beyond what's visible in the satellite image. This hidden context will enrich your game design and might inspire obstacle ideas later.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h3>What Makes a Landmark Legendary?</h3>\n        <p>\n            The best landmarks in games aren't just visually interesting - they tell stories and create memories. Think about iconic game locations you remember:\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>The first castle in Super Mario Bros - simple but unforgettable</li>\n            <li>Hyrule Castle in Zelda - visible from anywhere, drawing you toward it</li>\n            <li>The lighthouse in BioShock - a beginning and an ending point</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>\n            Your landmarks have the advantage of being real places with real history and significance. A game location based on the park where your community gathers for festivals has built-in meaning. The school where generations of students have learned carries weight. The bridge that connects two neighborhoods tells a story of connection.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n            Don't underestimate the power of local significance. To someone from across the world, your landmarks might seem ordinary. But to you and your community, they're special - and that specialness will shine through in how you design and build them.\n        </p>\n\n        <div class=\"inspiration-box\">\n            <h4>Real-World Connection</h4>\n            <p>\n                Game developers call these kinds of memorable locations \"POIs\" - Points of Interest. In open-world games, POIs serve as navigation waypoints, quest locations, and memorable setpieces that make the game world feel rich and explorable. By selecting your 5 landmarks, you're doing exactly what developers at companies like Nintendo, Rockstar, and Ubisoft do when designing game worlds: identifying the locations that will anchor the player's experience and create a sense of place.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"mission-check\">\n        <h2>Mission Check</h2>\n        <p>Before you complete this mission, verify you have:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Studied your satellite image to identify potential landmarks</li>\n            <li>Listed at least 10-15 possible landmark locations</li>\n            <li>Evaluated candidates using selection criteria (visual, personal, spatial, variety)</li>\n            <li>Selected exactly 5 landmarks for your obstacle stations</li>\n            <li>Ensured good spatial distribution across your island</li>\n            <li>Included variety in landmark types and categories</li>\n            <li>Marked all 5 landmarks on your satellite image (numbered or labeled)</li>\n            <li>Created a Landmark Registry with details for each location</li>\n            <li>Written at least one sentence explaining what makes each landmark special</li>\n            <li>Saved your marked-up satellite image showing all landmarks</li>\n        </ul>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"mission-bridge\">\n        <h2>Next Mission: Story Your Route</h2>\n        <p>\n            You have your island boundaries.

Each type creates different player motivation and suggests different route structures.\n        </p>\n\n        <h4>Story Type A: The Tour</h4>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Premise</strong>: The player is taking a tour of the island's most important or interesting locations.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Examples</strong>: \"Welcome to Island - Visit the 5 Wonders,\" \"New Student Orientation Tour,\" \"The Historic Landmarks Trail\"\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Best for</strong>: Islands with diverse landmark types that showcase different aspects of your area\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Route logic</strong>: Order landmarks to create a natural touring sequence, perhaps starting with an introduction point and ending at a vista or gathering place\n        </p>\n\n        <h4>Story Type B: The Challenge</h4>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Premise</strong>: Someone has issued a challenge - complete obstacle courses at 5 locations to prove yourself.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Examples</strong>: \"The Ultimate Island Challenge,\" \"Parkour Master Trial,\" \"Beat the Island Record\"\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Best for</strong>: Islands with athletic spaces (parks, fields, courts) that suggest physical challenges\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Route logic</strong>: Order landmarks by increasing difficulty, or create a circuit that tests different skills at each station\n        </p>\n\n        <h4>Story Type C: The Quest</h4>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Premise</strong>: The player is searching for something, and each landmark provides a clue or piece leading to the next location.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Examples</strong>: \"The Island Treasure Hunt,\" \"Solving the Mystery,\" \"Finding the Lost Artifact\"\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Best for</strong>: Islands with landmarks that have interesting history or unique characteristics\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Route logic</strong>: Create a sequence where each location logically leads to the next, building toward a climactic final location\n        </p>\n\n        <h4>Story Type D: The Race</h4>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Premise</strong>: A competitive race through checkpoints across the island, possibly against time or other runners.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Examples</strong>: \"Island Marathon Challenge,\" \"The Great Race,\" \"Beat the Clock Circuit\"\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Best for</strong>: Islands with clear paths between landmarks and good geographic flow\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Route logic</strong>: Minimize backtracking, create efficient paths, consider distance between checkpoints\n        </p>\n\n        <h4>Story Type E: The Journey</h4>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Premise</strong>: The player is traveling from one end of the island to the other, experiencing different neighborhoods or zones along the way.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Examples</strong>: \"From Shore to Shore,\" \"East to West Adventure,\" \"The Island Crossing\"\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Best for</strong>: Islands with clear geographic progression (coastline to inland, downtown to residential, etc.)\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Route logic</strong>: Start at one edge or corner, end at the opposite, with landmarks distributed along the path between\n        </p>\n\n        <h4>Story Type F: The Festival/Event</h4>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Premise</strong>: There's a special event happening, and participants must visit 5 festival stations across the island.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Examples</strong>: \"Island Festival Challenge,\" \"Carnival Circuit,\" \"Community Celebration Run\"\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Best for</strong>: Islands with public gathering spaces and community landmarks\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Route logic</strong>: Visit locations in any logical order, or create a circuit that returns to the starting festival grounds\n        </p>\n\n        <div class=\"try-it-box\">\n            <h4>Try It: Story Brainstorm</h4>\n            <p>\n                Look at your 5 landmarks. Which story type feels like the most natural fit? Write down 2-3 specific story ideas using different types. For example: \"The Historic Downtown Tour\" (Type A), \"The Parkside Challenge\" (Type B), or \"The Lost Mascot Mystery\" (Type C). Don't commit yet - just brainstorm possibilities.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h3>Step 2: Order Your Landmarks</h3>\n        <p>\n            Now that you have some story ideas brewing, it's time to decide the order in which players will visit your 5 landmarks. This is your route sequence.\n        </p>\n\n        <h4>Choosing Your Start Point (Station 1)</h4>\n        <p>\n            The first landmark players visit sets the tone for the entire journey. Good starting points are:\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>Welcoming and open</strong>: A park, plaza, or entrance point that feels like a natural beginning</li>\n            <li><strong>Clearly defined</strong>: Easy to recognize and locate in the satellite image</li>\n            <li><strong>Positioned well</strong>: Located so that it can lead naturally toward other landmarks</li>\n            <li><strong>Story-appropriate</strong>: Fits your narrative (a tour starts at an information point, a race starts at a start line, etc.)</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <h4>Choosing Your End Point (Station 5)</h4>\n        <p>\n            The final landmark should feel like a destination and provide a sense of completion:\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>Climactic</strong>: Something special or impressive that feels like an achievement to reach</li>\n            <li><strong>Conclusive</strong>: A location that provides natural closure (high point, special building, return to start)</li>\n            <li><strong>Memorable</strong>: Players should feel satisfied when they arrive here</li>\n            <li><strong>Story-appropriate</strong>: Completes your narrative arc</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <h4>Ordering the Middle Stations (2, 3, 4)</h4>\n        <p>\n            The three middle landmarks create the journey between start and finish. Consider:\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>Geographic flow</strong>: Does the route make sense on the map, or does it require confusing backtracking?</li>\n            <li><strong>Distance variation</strong>: Mix shorter and longer distances between stations to create pacing variety</li>\n            <li><strong>Terrain diversity</strong>: If possible, vary the types of landmarks (building, park, field, etc.) as players progress</li>\n            <li><strong>Narrative rhythm</strong>: Build tension, provide variety, or create a pattern that supports your story</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <div class=\"tip-box\">\n            <h4>The Route Line Test</h4>\n            <p>\n                Pull up your satellite image with marked landmarks. Using a different color from your previous markings, draw lines connecting your landmarks in your proposed order: 1→2→3→4→5. Does the route look reasonable? Or does it zigzag all over the place? A good route has clear direction and flow, though some doubling back can add interest.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h4>Common Route Patterns</h4>\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>Linear</strong>: Straight progression across the island (A → B → C → D → E)</li>\n            <li><strong>Circular/Loop</strong>: End point returns to or near start point (creates a circuit)</li>\n            <li><strong>Star Pattern</strong>: Hub in center with spokes to outer landmarks</li>\n            <li><strong>Spiral</strong>: Gradually work inward or outward from center</li>\n            <li><strong>Figure-8 or S-curve</strong>: Weaving pattern across island</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>\n            None of these patterns is inherently better than others - the best pattern is the one that serves your story and makes geographic sense for your specific landmarks.\n        </p>\n\n        <div class=\"try-it-box\">\n            <h4>Try It: Three Different Routes</h4>\n            <p>\n                Using your 5 landmarks, create three completely different route sequences. Maybe one goes clockwise around your island, another goes straight across, and a third spirals inward. Draw all three on your map (use different colors or labels). Which route feels best? Which tells the most interesting story? Which flows most naturally?\n            </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h3>Step 3: Develop Your Narrative</h3>\n        <p>\n            You have your story type and your route order. Now let's flesh out the narrative details that will make your island runner feel purposeful and engaging.\n        </p>\n\n        <h4>Create Your Story Hook</h4>\n        <p>\n            Write a 2-3 sentence \"story hook\" that explains what the player is doing and why. This is what would appear in your game's introduction or menu screen.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n            <strong>Example hooks:</strong>\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>\"Welcome to Harbor Island! To become an official Island Guide, you must complete the 5-Point Tour, visiting every major landmark and proving your knowledge of our home.\"</li>\n            <li>\"The Island Challenge has been issued! Only those who complete obstacle courses at all 5 legendary training grounds can claim the title of Island Champion.\"</li>\n            <li>\"The Island Festival trophy has been hidden somewhere on the island. Follow the clues at 5 festival stations to discover its location!\"</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <div class=\"creation-box\">\n            <h4>Your Story Hook</h4>\n            <p>\n                Write your story hook now. Remember:\n            </p>\n            <ul>\n                <li>Keep it simple and clear</li>\n                <li>Explain the goal (visit 5 landmarks)</li>\n                <li>Provide motivation (why does the player care?)</li>\n                <li>Set the tone (adventurous, competitive, exploratory, etc.)</li>\n                <li>Use your island's actual characteristics and landmarks</li>\n            </ul>\n        </div>\n\n        <h4>Name Each Station</h4>\n        <p>\n            Beyond just \"Landmark 1\" or \"The Park,\" give each station a name that ties into your narrative and makes it feel special.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n            <strong>Examples:</strong>\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>If your story is a challenge: \"The Park Parkour Course,\" \"The Library Climb,\" \"The Bridge Sprint\"</li>\n            <li>If your story is a tour: \"Welcome Plaza - The Starting Point,\" \"Historic Library - Culture Stop,\" \"Harbor View - Final Vista\"</li>\n            <li>If your story is a quest: \"First Clue - The Old Oak,\" \"Second Trial - The Stone Bridge,\" \"The Final Answer - Summit Point\"</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>\n            These names serve multiple purposes:\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Make each location memorable and distinct</li>\n            <li>Reinforce your story theme</li>\n            <li>Give you clear labels to use when building in Roblox later</li>\n            <li>Help players understand each location's role in the journey</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <h4>Write Station Descriptions</h4>\n        <p>\n            For each of your 5 stations (in route order), write a short description (2-3 sentences) that includes:\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>What the location is in the real world</li>\n            <li>What it represents in your game story</li>\n            <li>What the player will do there (even if you don't know exactly what obstacle yet)</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>\n            <strong>Example:</strong>\n        </p>\n        <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\n            <strong>Station 1: Memorial Park - Journey's Beginning</strong><br>\n            This peaceful park in the heart of downtown marks the traditional starting point for all Island Challenges. Here, runners warm up with basic parkour training among the old oak trees. Complete the introductory obstacle course to prove you're ready for the journey ahead.\n        </p>\n\n        <div class=\"tip-box\">\n            <h4>Consistency is Key</h4>\n            <p>\n                Make sure your station descriptions all support the same story. If Station 1 talks about \"ancient island traditions\" but Station 3 mentions \"modern competitive racing,\" your narrative feels disjointed. Keep the tone, vocabulary, and premise consistent across all five stations.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h3>Step 4: Map Your Route</h3>\n        <p>\n            Now let's create the final, definitive route map that shows your complete island runner journey.\n        </p>\n\n        <h4>Creating Your Route Map</h4>\n        <ol>\n            <li>Open your satellite image (the one with landmarks marked from Mission 2.3)</li>\n            <li>If you experimented with multiple route orders, choose your final sequence now</li>\n            <li>Relabel your landmarks with their final route numbers and story names:\n                <ul>\n                    <li>Station 1: [Story Name]</li>\n                    <li>Station 2: [Story Name]</li>\n                    <li>Station 3: [Story Name]</li>\n                    <li>Station 4: [Story Name]</li>\n                    <li>Station 5: [Story Name]</li>\n                </ul>\n            </li>\n            <li>Draw route lines connecting the stations in sequence: 1→2→2→3→3→4→4→5</li>\n            <li>Use arrows to show direction of travel</li>\n            <li>Make the route path visually distinct (thick line, bright color, etc.)</li>\n        </ol>\n\n        <p>\n            Your final route map should clearly show:\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Your island boundary from Mission 2.2</li>\n            <li>All 5 stations with numbers and names</li>\n            <li>The path connecting them in sequence</li>\n            <li>Direction arrows showing route flow</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <div class=\"creation-box\">\n            <h4>Add a Title and Legend</h4>\n            <p>\n                Make your map official by adding:\n            </p>\n            <ul>\n                <li>A title at the top: \"[Your Island Name] - [Your Story Name]\"</li>\n                <li>A simple legend explaining what the markings mean</li>\n                <li>Your name as the designer</li>\n                <li>The date you created it</li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>\n                This might seem like extra work, but documentation is crucial in game development. Future you (when you're building in Roblox) will appreciate having a clear, labeled map to reference.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h3>Step 5: Consider Travel Between Stations</h3>\n        <p>\n            Your route isn't just about the stations themselves - it's also about the journey between them. Let's think about what players experience while traveling from station to station.\n        </p>\n\n        <h4>Distance and Pacing</h4>\n        <p>\n            Look at your route map. Estimate the distance between each pair of consecutive stations:\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Station 1 → Station 2: [Short/Medium/Long distance]</li>\n            <li>Station 2 → Station 3: [Short/Medium/Long distance]</li>\n            <li>Station 3 → Station 4: [Short/Medium/Long distance]</li>\n            <li>Station 4 → Station 5: [Short/Medium/Long distance]</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>\n            Ideally, you want variety in these distances. A route where every segment is exactly the same length can feel monotonous. Mix it up when possible.\n        </p>\n\n        <h4>Terrain and Obstacles</h4>\n        <p>\n            What lies between your stations? Look at your satellite image along each route segment:\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Are there roads to cross?</li>\n            <li>Open parks to run through?</li>\n            <li>Buildings to navigate around?</li>\n            <li>Water to potentially bridge?</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>\n            These environmental features will become part of your game world later. For now, just note them. They'll influence how you build your island in Roblox Studio.\n        </p>\n\n        <div class=\"try-it-box\">\n            <h4>Try It: Imagine the Journey</h4>\n            <p>\n                Close your eyes and imagine actually running your route in real life. Start at Station 1. What do you see as you travel to Station 2? What landmarks pass by? What does the environment change to? Walk through the entire route mentally, noting interesting features along the way. These observations will enrich your later building work.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h3>Step 6: Compile Your Design Document</h3>\n        <p>\n            You've done tremendous planning work. Now let's organize it all into a clear design document that you'll reference throughout the building phase.\n        </p>\n\n        <h4>Your Island Runner Design Document</h4>\n        <p>\n            Create a document (digital or paper) with the following sections:\n        </p>\n\n        <h5>1. Project Overview</h5>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Island name</li>\n            <li>Story type</li>\n            <li>Story hook (2-3 sentence premise)</li>\n            <li>Design date</li>\n            <li>Your name as designer</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <h5>2. Island Map</h5>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Your complete satellite image showing boundary, stations, and route</li>\n            <li>Title and legend included</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <h5>3. Station Guide</h5>\n        <p>For each station in route order:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Station number and story name</li>\n            <li>Real-world landmark name and type</li>\n            <li>Story description (2-3 sentences)</li>\n            <li>Why you chose this location</li>\n            <li>Initial obstacle ideas (even if vague)</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <h5>4. Route Notes</h5>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Total number of stations: 5</li>\n            <li>Route pattern (linear, loop, etc.)</li>\n            <li>Start point justification</li>\n            <li>End point justification</li>\n            <li>Special environmental features along route</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <h5>5. Future Ideas</h5>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Potential obstacles for each station</li>\n            <li>Environmental details you want to include</li>\n            <li>Extra landmarks for possible future expansion</li>\n            <li>Any other creative ideas that came up during planning</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <div class=\"tip-box\">\n            <h4>Save Everything</h4>\n            <p>\n                Your design document is your game's blueprint. Save it somewhere safe and accessible. When you start building in Roblox Studio (in the next Star), this document will guide every decision you make. Professional game developers create documents like this for every project - you're learning real industry practice.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h3>The Power of Story in Games</h3>\n        <p>\n            Why does story matter so much in a game about running and obstacles? Because story creates meaning. Without a story, your island runner is just \"go to these five places.\" With a story, it becomes \"complete the Island Challenge\" or \"discover the hidden treasure\" or \"explore your hometown's wonders.\"\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n            Story also helps you make design decisions. When you're building in Roblox later and you're not sure what color to make something or which obstacle fits better, you can ask: \"What serves the story?\" The story becomes your guide.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n            Even simple stories create player investment. When players understand why they're running through your island, they care about completing the journey. And when players care, they remember the experience.\n        </p>\n\n        <div class=\"inspiration-box\">\n            <h4>Real-World Connection</h4>\n            <p>\n                Narrative designers in game companies do exactly what you just did: they create story frameworks that give players motivation and direction. They sequence levels to create story arcs. They name locations to reinforce themes. They write descriptions that make players care about virtual places. The design document you created is the same kind of document that professionals use to communicate vision and keep development teams aligned. You've just completed genuine narrative design work.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h3>Celebrate Your Planning</h3>\n        <p>\n            You've completed all four missions in the Island Vision star.

Many game projects fail because developers skip the planning phase and jump straight to building. You've done the smart thing: you've researched, designed, and documented before touching any building tools. This foundation will make the actual construction process smoother, faster, and more focused.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n            Take a moment to appreciate your design. Share it with friends, family, or classmates if you want. Show them your route map and explain your story. Their reactions will tell you if your narrative is clear and compelling.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n            And get excited - because in the next star, you'll start bringing this plan to life in Roblox Studio.\n        </p>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"mission-check\">\n        <h2>Mission Check</h2>\n        <p>Before you complete this mission, verify you have:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Reviewed all story type options and chosen one that fits your island</li>\n            <li>Selected a starting landmark (Station 1) with clear justification</li>\n            <li>Selected an ending landmark (Station 5) that provides closure</li>\n            <li>Ordered all 5 landmarks into a logical route sequence</li>\n            <li>Drawn the complete route on your satellite map with directional arrows</li>\n            <li>Created a story hook (2-3 sentences) explaining the premise</li>\n            <li>Given each station a story-appropriate name</li>\n            <li>Written a description for each station explaining its role</li>\n            <li>Verified your route makes geographic sense and flows well</li>\n            <li>Compiled a complete design document with all planning elements</li>\n            <li>Saved your final route map with title, legend, and labels</li>\n            <li>Noted interesting environmental features along your route</li>\n        </ul>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"mission-bridge\">\n        <h2>Congratulations - Star 2 Complete!</h2>\n        <p>\n            You've finished Island Vision!

It's time to bring it into your world. Not as a second screen or a printout on your desk, but as an actual object in your 3D workspace. Professional game developers use reference images like this all the time—they place them right in the scene so they can build around them, checking proportions and shapes as they work.</p>\n        <p>You're about to learn a crucial workflow technique: using decals as building guides. By the end of this mission, your satellite image will be lying flat on the ground in Roblox Studio, ready to serve as your blueprint for island construction.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"mission-objective\">\n        <h2>Mission Objective</h2>\n        <p>Import your satellite screenshot as a decal placed flat on the ground in your Roblox world to guide your island building process.</p>\n        <p><strong>Success Criteria:</strong> Your satellite image appears as a decal on a horizontal part in your workspace, clearly showing your island's shape and landmarks.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"mission-content-main\">\n        <h2>Why Reference Images Matter</h2>\n        <p>Building 3D environments from memory or imagination alone is difficult. Professional 3D artists and level designers use reference images constantly—they import photos, sketches, and maps directly into their 3D software to guide their work. This technique ensures accuracy, saves time, and helps you stay focused on your original vision.</p>\n        <p>In our case, your satellite screenshot contains all the information you need: the island's overall shape, the location of landmarks, how paths connect different areas, and the scale relationships between features. By placing this image in your world, you can literally build on top of it.</p>\n\n        <h2>Step 1: Prepare Your Reference Platform</h2>\n        <p>Before you can add a decal, you need a surface to place it on. We'll create a large, flat part that will hold your satellite image.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"instruction-block\">\n            <p><strong>Create the base part:</strong></p>\n            <ol>\n                <li>In the Home tab, click the <strong>Part</strong> button to insert a new part</li>\n                <li>With the part selected, look at the Properties panel</li>\n                <li>Find the <strong>Size</strong> property</li>\n                <li>Change the size to <code>200, 1, 200</code> (this creates a large, thin platform)</li>\n                <li>In the <strong>Position</strong> property, set it to <code>0, 0.5, 0</code> to place it at ground level</li>\n            </ol>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"tip-box\">\n            <h3>Understanding Part Dimensions</h3>\n            <p>Roblox parts use Size values in the format X, Y, Z where X is width, Y is height, and Z is depth. Our setting of <code>200, 1, 200</code> creates a very wide, very flat, square platform—perfect for displaying an image.</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Step 2: Organize Your Workspace</h2>\n        <p>Before importing your image, let's organize this part properly so your workspace doesn't get messy as your project grows.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"instruction-block\">\n            <ol>\n                <li>Right-click on the part in the Explorer panel</li>\n                <li>Select <strong>Rename</strong></li>\n                <li>Name it <code>ReferenceImagePlatform</code></li>\n                <li>In the Properties panel, find <strong>Anchored</strong> and check the box (this prevents it from falling or moving during testing)</li>\n            </ol>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Step 3: Import Your Satellite Screenshot</h2>\n        <p>Now comes the exciting part—bringing your satellite image into Roblox Studio.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"instruction-block\">\n            <p><strong>Upload your image:</strong></p>\n            <ol>\n                <li>In the Explorer, make sure your <code>ReferenceImagePlatform</code> is selected</li>\n                <li>In the Home tab, find the <strong>Insert</strong> section</li>\n                <li>Click <strong>Decal</strong> (this inserts a decal as a child of your selected part)</li>\n                <li>Look in the Explorer—you should see \"Decal\" nested under your platform part</li>\n                <li>With the Decal selected, look at the Properties panel</li>\n                <li>Find the <strong>Texture</strong> property</li>\n                <li>Click the small icon next to the Texture field</li>\n                <li>In the Asset Manager that opens, click <strong>Add Image</strong></li>\n                <li>Navigate to where you saved your satellite screenshot from Star 2</li>\n                <li>Select the image and click <strong>Open</strong></li>\n                <li>Wait for the image to upload (you'll see a progress indicator)</li>\n                <li>Once uploaded, click the image thumbnail to apply it to your decal</li>\n            </ol>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"tip-box\">\n            <h3>Image Upload Requirements</h3>\n            <p>Roblox accepts common image formats like PNG, JPG, and BMP. The upload may take a few moments depending on your internet connection. Once uploaded, the image is stored in your account and can be reused in any project.</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Step 4: Orient the Decal Correctly</h2>\n        <p>By default, the decal might appear on the wrong face of your part.

Then hold the right mouse button and use WASD keys to fly above it and look straight down. You should see your satellite image clearly displayed, showing your island's shape and features. This bird's-eye view is how you'll work as you build.</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Step 5: Fine-Tune the Reference Setup</h2>\n        <p>Let's make a few final adjustments to make this reference as useful as possible.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"instruction-block\">\n            <p><strong>Optimize your reference platform:</strong></p>\n            <ol>\n                <li>Select your <code>ReferenceImagePlatform</code> in the Explorer</li>\n                <li>In Properties, find <strong>Transparency</strong></li>\n                <li>Set it to <code>0.3</code> (this makes the part slightly transparent so you can see if you accidentally build inside it)</li>\n                <li>Find the <strong>CanCollide</strong> property</li>\n                <li>Uncheck it (this prevents the platform from blocking your character during testing)</li>\n                <li>Find <strong>Color</strong> and set it to white or a light gray (this ensures the color doesn't tint your satellite image)</li>\n            </ol>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"tip-box\">\n            <h3>Creating a Reference Folder</h3>\n            <p>For better organization, you can create a folder in the Workspace called \"BuildingReferences\" and move your platform into it. Right-click in the Explorer, select Insert Object, choose Folder, rename it, then drag your reference platform into that folder. This keeps your main workspace clean as you add terrain and structures.</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Understanding Your New Workflow</h2>\n        <p>What you've just created is a professional-level workflow tool. As you build your island in the next missions, you'll constantly refer back to this image. You'll match the outline of your terrain to the coastline in the photo. You'll position landmarks where they appear in the satellite view. You'll create paths that follow the routes visible in your reference.</p>\n        <p>This isn't \"cheating\"—it's exactly how real game developers work. They gather references, import them into their tools, and use them to guide accurate, thoughtful construction.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"try-it-box\">\n            <h3>Try It: Test Your Reference Scale</h3>\n            <p>Insert a new part into your workspace (don't worry about being precise—just drop one in). Move it around above your reference image. Notice how you can use the satellite photo to judge where things should go? That's the power of in-world references. You can always see your plan while you work.</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Common Issues and Solutions</h2>\n        <div class=\"troubleshooting\">\n            <p><strong>Issue:</strong> My decal isn't showing up at all.</p>\n            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Check that the Decal object is a child of your platform part in the Explorer. Also verify the Face property is set to \"Top\" and the Texture property shows your uploaded image.</p>\n\n            <p><strong>Issue:</strong> The image looks stretched or distorted.</p>\n            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Your satellite screenshot might not be square. Try adjusting your platform's size to match your image's proportions. If your image is wider than it is tall, make the X value larger than the Z value (e.g., <code>250, 1, 200</code>).</p>\n\n            <p><strong>Issue:</strong> I can't find my saved satellite image.</p>\n            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Go back to Star 2 and take a new screenshot. Make sure to save it somewhere memorable like your Desktop or Documents folder. You can also create a \"Roblox Project Assets\" folder to keep all your game development files organized.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"mission-check\">\n        <h2>Mission Check</h2>\n        <p>Before moving forward, verify you've completed these requirements:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Created a large, flat platform part (200x1x200 or similar)</li>\n            <li>Uploaded your satellite screenshot from Star 2 to Roblox</li>\n            <li>Applied the image as a decal on the TOP face of your platform</li>\n            <li>Set the platform to be anchored, non-collidable, and slightly transparent</li>\n            <li>Can clearly see your island's shape and landmarks in the reference image</li>\n            <li>Can navigate your camera to view the reference from directly above</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>If you can check all these boxes, you're ready to start building actual terrain.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"mission-bridge\">\n        <h2>Next Mission Preview</h2>\n        <p>Your reference is in place.

Now we'll add more parts to capture the actual shape.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"instruction-block\">\n            <p><strong>Add additional parts to match your outline:</strong></p>\n            <ol>\n                <li>Look at your reference—where does your island extend beyond your base part?</li>\n                <li>Insert additional parts and position them to fill in those areas</li>\n                <li>Where your island is smaller than the base, we'll address that in a moment</li>\n                <li>Use the <strong>Move</strong> and <strong>Scale</strong> tools to position parts precisely</li>\n                <li>Make sure all terrain parts have <strong>Anchored</strong> checked</li>\n                <li>Name each part descriptively: <code>IslandNorthSection</code>, <code>IslandPeninsula</code>, etc.</li>\n            </ol>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"tip-box\">\n            <h3>Working with Overlapping Parts</h3>\n            <p>It's perfectly fine for your terrain parts to overlap each other. In fact, this is often easier than trying to make them fit together perfectly. The important thing is the overall silhouette when viewed from above matches your reference.</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Step 4: Add Basic Elevation</h2>\n        <p>Real islands aren't flat. Let's create some basic height variation to make your island more interesting.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"instruction-block\">\n            <p><strong>Create hills or elevated areas:</strong></p>\n            <ol>\n                <li>Study your reference for areas that appear darker or show shadows (these are often higher ground)</li>\n                <li>Insert new parts where you want elevated areas</li>\n                <li>Make these parts smaller in X and Z dimensions but taller in Y</li>\n                <li>Position them on top of your base terrain</li>\n                <li>Example: <code>60, 20, 60</code> creates a hill-sized elevation</li>\n                <li>Name these parts clearly: <code>CentralHill</code>, <code>NorthRidge</code>, etc.</li>\n            </ol>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"instruction-block\">\n            <p><strong>Create lower areas (beaches or shores):</strong></p>\n            <ol>\n                <li>Beaches appear lighter in satellite images (sand reflects more light)</li>\n                <li>Insert thin, flat parts around your island's edges</li>\n                <li>Example size: <code>40, 1, 20</code> creates a beach-like strip</li>\n                <li>Position them just above or at water level (Y position around 1-2)</li>\n                <li>These will serve as your coastal zones</li>\n            </ol>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Step 5: Organize Your Terrain</h2>\n        <p>As you add parts, your Explorer panel gets messy. Let's keep things organized.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"instruction-block\">\n            <ol>\n                <li>In the Explorer, right-click in the Workspace</li>\n                <li>Select <strong>Insert Object</strong> and choose <strong>Folder</strong></li>\n                <li>Name it <code>IslandTerrain</code></li>\n                <li>Drag all your island parts into this folder</li>\n                <li>Your reference platform should stay separate (in a different folder or loose in Workspace)</li>\n            </ol>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Step 6: Compare and Iterate</h2>\n        <p>The key to good reference-based building is constant comparison. Let's develop that workflow.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"instruction-block\">\n            <p><strong>Check your work:</strong></p>\n            <ol>\n                <li>Position your camera directly above your island, looking down</li>\n                <li>Zoom out until you can see your whole island and most of the reference</li>\n                <li>Look for areas where your terrain doesn't match the reference outline</li>\n                <li>Ask yourself: Is the general shape right? Are the proportions similar?</li>\n                <li>Make adjustments: move parts, resize them, add new ones, or delete ones that aren't working</li>\n            </ol>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"tip-box\">\n            <h3>Perfect vs. Good Enough</h3>\n            <p>At this stage, you're creating foundations, not final terrain. Your island doesn't need to match your reference perfectly—it needs to match <em>roughly</em>. You'll add details and refinements throughout the rest of this Star. Right now, aim for \"clearly recognizable as the same island\" rather than \"exactly identical.\"</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Understanding Scale in Game Development</h2>\n        <p>One challenge you might face is scale. Your reference image represents a real place that might be hundreds of meters across. But in your game, you need it to be playable—big enough to feel like an island but small enough that players can traverse it in a reasonable time.</p>\n        <p>Here's a useful guideline: Roblox characters are about 5 studs tall. A part that's 100 studs across takes about 10 seconds to run across. Use this to judge your island size. For a runner game, you probably want your island to be 200-500 studs across—large enough for an interesting course but not so huge that it takes minutes to traverse.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"try-it-box\">\n            <h3>Try It: Test the Scale</h3>\n            <p>Press the <strong>Play</strong> button in the Test section of the Home tab. When your character spawns, run around on your island terrain. Does it feel too big? Too small? Stop the test (press the Stop button) and adjust your terrain part sizes accordingly. This trial-and-error process is normal and important.</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Bonus: Introduction to Terrain Tools</h2>\n        <p>If you're feeling adventurous, you can experiment with Roblox's built-in terrain system alongside or instead of parts.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"instruction-block\">\n            <p><strong>Access terrain tools:</strong></p>\n            <ol>\n                <li>In the Home tab, find the <strong>Terrain</strong> section</li>\n                <li>Click <strong>Generate</strong> to create an initial terrain area, or use <strong>Add</strong> to manually sculpt</li>\n                <li>The <strong>Add</strong> tool lets you paint terrain material (grass, sand, rock) directly into your world</li>\n                <li>Adjust the brush size and strength in the Terrain Editor panel</li>\n                <li>Use your reference image to guide where you paint land versus leaving empty space (which becomes water)</li>\n            </ol>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"tip-box\">\n            <h3>Terrain Tips for Beginners</h3>\n            <p>Start with a large brush size to quickly block out the general shape, then switch to smaller brushes for details. The <strong>Grow</strong> tool is useful for expanding terrain areas, while <strong>Erode</strong> smooths out blocky edges. Don't worry about making it perfect—terrain sculpting is an art that improves with practice.</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Common Building Challenges</h2>\n        <div class=\"troubleshooting\">\n            <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> My parts keep falling when I test the game.</p>\n            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Make sure every terrain part has <strong>Anchored</strong> checked in Properties. Anchored parts ignore gravity and stay exactly where you place them.</p>\n\n            <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> I can't see my reference image anymore under all my terrain parts.</p>\n            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Select all your terrain parts (click one, then hold Ctrl and click others) and in Properties, adjust <strong>Transparency</strong> to something like 0.3-0.5. This makes them semi-transparent so you can see through to your reference below.</p>\n\n            <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> My island shape doesn't match my reference well.</p>\n            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> This is normal in early stages. Focus on getting the general proportions right first. Also, take a screenshot of your reference and draw over it in a simple paint program to outline the basic geometric shapes you see—this makes it easier to recreate in 3D.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"mission-check\">\n        <h2>Mission Check</h2>\n        <p>Verify your island foundations are ready before continuing:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Created a base landmass that roughly matches your island's footprint</li>\n            <li>Added additional parts to capture the overall shape of your island</li>\n            <li>Included at least one elevated area (hill) and one lower area (beach/shore)</li>\n            <li>All terrain parts are anchored and organized in a folder</li>\n            <li>When viewed from above, your terrain clearly resembles your reference image's outline</li>\n            <li>Tested scale by running around on your island—it feels appropriately sized</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>Your island doesn't need to be perfect, but it should be recognizable as the place in your satellite photo.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"mission-bridge\">\n        <h2>Next Mission Preview</h2>\n        <p>You've built the bones of your island—the basic landmass is in place. But right now it probably looks pretty bland: gray blocks sitting on the ground. In Mission 3.3, you'll learn about part properties like materials, colors, and transparency.

If you're like most beginners, it's a collection of gray blocks roughly shaped like your satellite reference. It's functional, but it doesn't look like a real place yet. This is where the magic happens.</p>\n        <p>Professional environment artists use a technique called \"material definition\"—using surface properties to tell players what things are made of and how they should feel. A sandy beach doesn't just look different from a grassy hill because of color; it has different texture, reflectivity, and visual character. You're about to learn how to create that distinction in Roblox, turning your gray prototype into a vibrant, believable world.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"mission-objective\">\n        <h2>Mission Objective</h2>\n        <p>Apply appropriate materials, colors, and transparency settings to your island terrain parts to create distinct visual zones that communicate what each area represents.</p>\n        <p><strong>Success Criteria:</strong> Your island has clear visual variety with at least 3 different materials applied, colors that feel natural, and appropriate use of properties to create environmental atmosphere.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"mission-content-main\">\n        <h2>Understanding Materials in Roblox</h2>\n        <p>Every part in Roblox has a Material property that controls how its surface looks. Materials aren't just about color—they define texture, how light reflects, and the overall visual character of an object.</p>\n        <p>Roblox provides dozens of materials, but for natural environments, these are the most useful:</p>\n\n        <div class=\"material-reference\">\n            <ul>\n                <li><strong>Grass:</strong> Perfect for fields, hills, and natural areas</li>\n                <li><strong>Sand:</strong> Beaches, desert areas, sandy paths</li>\n                <li><strong>Ground:</strong> Dirt paths, exposed earth, brown terrain</li>\n                <li><strong>Rock:</strong> Cliffs, boulders, mountain areas</li>\n                <li><strong>Slate:</strong> Refined stone, paved areas, urban zones</li>\n                <li><strong>Concrete:</strong> Modern structures, pathways, developed areas</li>\n                <li><strong>Wood:</strong> Bridges, platforms, wooden structures</li>\n                <li><strong>Leafy Grass:</strong> Lush vegetation, forest floors</li>\n            </ul>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Step 1: Apply Materials to Base Terrain</h2>\n        <p>Let's start by defining what your main terrain areas are made of.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"instruction-block\">\n            <p><strong>Add materials to your island base:</strong></p>\n            <ol>\n                <li>Select your <code>IslandBase</code> part (or whatever you named your main landmass)</li>\n                <li>In the Properties panel, scroll to find <strong>Material</strong></li>\n                <li>Click the dropdown and select <strong>Grass</strong></li>\n                <li>Notice how the part immediately changes—it now has a grass texture instead of smooth gray</li>\n                <li>Rotate your camera around the part to see how the material looks from different angles</li>\n            </ol>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"tip-box\">\n            <h3>Material Visual Characteristics</h3>\n            <p>Each material has its own texture pattern that repeats across the surface. The pattern scale is automatic based on the part's size. Very large parts will show the texture pattern more clearly, while small parts might only show a portion of the pattern.</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Step 2: Create Environmental Zones</h2>\n        <p>Now let's use different materials to create distinct areas on your island, based on what you see in your reference image.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"instruction-block\">\n            <p><strong>Identify and material-ize your zones:</strong></p>\n            <ol>\n                <li>Look at your satellite reference—identify different terrain types</li>\n                <li>Coastal areas: Select beach/shore parts and apply <strong>Sand</strong> material</li>\n                <li>Elevated areas: Select hill parts and try <strong>Grass</strong> or <strong>Rock</strong> depending on what your reference shows</li>\n                <li>Forest/dark areas: Use <strong>Leafy Grass</strong> or darker <strong>Ground</strong> material</li>\n                <li>Developed areas: If your island has buildings or roads, use <strong>Concrete</strong> or <strong>Slate</strong></li>\n            </ol>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"try-it-box\">\n            <h3>Try It: Material Experimentation</h3>\n            <p>Select one of your terrain parts and rapidly switch between different materials using the Material dropdown. Notice how dramatically the part's character changes? Cobblestone feels medieval, Concrete feels modern, Glacier feels cold and remote. Materials communicate <em>feeling</em>, not just appearance.</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Step 3: Apply Color for Atmosphere</h2>\n        <p>Materials provide texture, but color adds life and specificity. Let's learn to use color thoughtfully.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"instruction-block\">\n            <p><strong>Add color to your terrain:</strong></p>\n            <ol>\n                <li>Select a grass-material part</li>\n                <li>In Properties, find <strong>Color</strong> (sometimes labeled as BrickColor)</li>\n                <li>Click on the color swatch to open the color picker</li>\n                <li>Choose a natural green—not too bright, not too dark</li>\n                <li>Apply different shades of green to different grass areas for variety</li>\n                <li>For sand parts, try warm yellows or light tans</li>\n                <li>For rock areas, use grays, browns, or dark earth tones</li>\n            </ol>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"tip-box\">\n            <h3>Color Theory for Game Environments</h3>\n            <p>Natural environments rarely use pure, saturated colors. Real grass isn't bright lime green; it's a muted, slightly brownish green. Real sand isn't pure yellow; it has gray or orange undertones. When choosing colors, think about what you see in nature. Slightly desaturated colors usually look more realistic than vivid ones.</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Step 4: Create Variety Within Zones</h2>\n        <p>Real environments aren't uniform. A forest doesn't have every tree the exact same shade of green. Let's add subtle variation.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"instruction-block\">\n            <p><strong>Vary your colors:</strong></p>\n            <ol>\n                <li>Select multiple parts in the same zone (hold Ctrl while clicking)</li>\n                <li>Notice that when multiple parts are selected, Properties shows their shared properties</li>\n                <li>Change each part's color individually to slightly different shades</li>\n                <li>For example, make some grass parts more yellow-green, others more blue-green</li>\n                <li>Keep the variations subtle—they should feel like natural variation, not like different zones</li>\n            </ol>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Step 5: Explore Advanced Properties</h2>\n        <p>Beyond material and color, Roblox parts have other properties that affect appearance. Let's experiment with the most useful ones.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"instruction-block\">\n            <p><strong>Transparency:</strong></p>\n            <ol>\n                <li>Find the <strong>Transparency</strong> property (value from 0 to 1)</li>\n                <li>0 = completely solid (opaque)</li>\n                <li>1 = completely invisible (transparent)</li>\n                <li>Try setting a water part to transparency 0.5 for a glass-like effect</li>\n                <li>Use slight transparency (0.1-0.2) on distant terrain for atmospheric depth</li>\n            </ol>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"instruction-block\">\n            <p><strong>Reflectance:</strong></p>\n            <ol>\n                <li>Find the <strong>Reflectance</strong> property (value from 0 to 1)</li>\n                <li>Controls how mirror-like a surface is</li>\n                <li>Try setting a rock part to 0.3 for wet-looking stone</li>\n                <li>Use on water parts for a reflective surface</li>\n                <li>Most natural terrain should have low reflectance (0-0.2)</li>\n            </ol>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"tip-box\">\n            <h3>When to Use Advanced Properties</h3>\n            <p>Transparency and reflectance are powerful but should be used sparingly. Too much transparency makes your world feel ghostly and undefined. Too much reflectance makes everything look wet or plastic. Use these properties for specific effects: water, glass, wet surfaces, or magical elements.</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Step 6: Create Visual Hierarchy</h2>\n        <p>In environment design, important areas should stand out while background areas recede. Let's use properties to create this hierarchy.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"instruction-block\">\n            <p><strong>Establish focal points:</strong></p>\n            <ol>\n                <li>Identify where your first landmark will be (from Mission 3.4)</li>\n                <li>Make terrain around that area slightly brighter or more saturated</li>\n                <li>Use a more interesting material—perhaps <strong>Slate</strong> instead of plain <strong>Ground</strong></li>\n                <li>For distant background terrain, use more muted colors and simpler materials</li>\n                <li>This guides players' eyes toward important gameplay areas</li>\n            </ol>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Understanding Visual Consistency</h2>\n        <p>While variety is important, so is consistency. Your island should feel like one cohesive place, not a random collection of parts. Here are guidelines for maintaining visual consistency:</p>\n\n        <div class=\"best-practices\">\n            <ul>\n                <li><strong>Color palette:</strong> Choose 4-6 main colors and use variations of those throughout</li>\n                <li><strong>Material logic:</strong> Use materials that make sense together (grass + sand + rock feels natural; grass + neon + ice feels random)</li>\n                <li><strong>Transition zones:</strong> Where two different materials meet, consider adding a transition (ground between grass and sand)</li>\n                <li><strong>Lighting consideration:</strong> Remember that Roblox's lighting will affect how your colors look—test in actual gameplay</li>\n            </ul>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"try-it-box\">\n            <h3>Try It: The Squint Test</h3>\n            <p>Zoom your camera way out so your entire island is visible. Squint your eyes (or blur your vision slightly). Do you see clear zones of different colors and textures? Or does everything blend together? If it all blends, you need more variety. If it looks chaotic, you need more consistency. This \"squint test\" is a real technique artists use to check visual hierarchy.</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Creating an Environmental Mood</h2>\n        <p>The properties you choose create an overall feeling or mood. Let's think about what mood fits your island.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"mood-guide\">\n            <p><strong>Tropical paradise:</strong> Bright grass colors, light sand, high saturation, clean materials</p>\n            <p><strong>Mysterious forest:</strong> Dark greens, browns, Leafy Grass material, low saturation</p>\n            <p><strong>Rocky highlands:</strong> Grays, browns, Rock and Slate materials, rough textures</p>\n            <p><strong>Coastal town:</strong> Mix of natural (grass, sand) and built (concrete, wood), varied colors</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <p>Look at your satellite reference. What mood does that real place have? Use your material and color choices to evoke that same feeling.</p>\n\n        <h2>Common Design Pitfalls</h2>\n        <div class=\"troubleshooting\">\n            <p><strong>Pitfall:</strong> Using too many different materials (10+ materials on a small island).</p>\n            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Limit yourself to 4-6 main materials.

They break complex structures into simple components. Let's do that.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"instruction-block\">\n            <p><strong>Analyze your landmark:</strong></p>\n            <ol>\n                <li>If possible, look up additional photos of this landmark online or recall what it looks like in person</li>\n                <li>Identify the main geometric shapes: rectangles? Cylinders? Wedges?</li>\n                <li>List the main components (e.g., playground = slide, swing set, climbing structure, platform)</li>\n                <li>Decide which components are essential and which can be simplified or omitted</li>\n                <li>Sketch a quick mental map of how these components relate spatially</li>\n            </ol>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"tip-box\">\n            <h3>Simplification is Not Cheating</h3>\n            <p>You don't need to recreate every detail of the real landmark. A building might have 100 windows in real life—in your game, 6-8 windows might be enough to communicate \"building.\" A playground might have 15 different pieces of equipment—you might build 4-5 key pieces. Game design is about capturing the essence, not replicating every detail.</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Step 3: Build the Base Structure</h2>\n        <p>Start with the largest, most fundamental component of your landmark.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"instruction-block\">\n            <p><strong>Create the foundation:</strong></p>\n            <ol>\n                <li>Identify the main \"body\" of your landmark (the biggest or most central part)</li>\n                <li>Insert a part and scale it to roughly match that component's size</li>\n                <li>Position it near your landmark marker</li>\n                <li>Apply appropriate material and color (brick for buildings, plastic for playground equipment, etc.)</li>\n                <li>Make sure it's <strong>Anchored</strong></li>\n                <li>Name it descriptively: <code>Playground_MainPlatform</code> or <code>Building_MainStructure</code></li>\n            </ol>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Step 4: Add Platforming Elements</h2>\n        <p>Now transform your structure from a static object into a gameplay space. This is where level design thinking becomes crucial.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"instruction-block\">\n            <p><strong>Create your first obstacle:</strong></p>\n            <ol>\n                <li>Insert a new part near your base structure</li>\n                <li>Size it as a platform: about <code>8, 1, 8</code> studs (big enough to land on)</li>\n                <li>Position it higher than your base structure by about 5-7 studs (this is a comfortable jump height)</li>\n                <li>Anchor it, apply material/color, and name it <code>Landmark_Platform1</code></li>\n                <li>This is your first jumping platform</li>\n            </ol>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"gameplay-principle\">\n            <h3>Jump Height Guidelines</h3>\n            <p>Roblox characters can jump about 7.5 studs high.

Let's add recognizable details.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"instruction-block\">\n            <p><strong>Build identifying features:</strong></p>\n            <ol>\n                <li>What makes this landmark distinctive? (A specific shape, color, or structure?)</li>\n                <li>Add parts that communicate these features</li>\n                <li>For a building: add walls, windows (using decals or colored parts), a roof shape</li>\n                <li>For a playground: add slide shapes (wedges), swing chains (cylinders), recognizable equipment</li>\n                <li>These parts don't all need to be functional obstacles—some can be purely visual</li>\n                <li>Use materials and colors to reinforce what the landmark is</li>\n            </ol>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"tip-box\">\n            <h3>Balancing Form and Function</h3>\n            <p>Some parts serve gameplay (platforms to jump on). Some parts serve recognition (details that make it look like the real place). The best landmark designs integrate both: a building's windowsills become ledges to jump to, a playground's equipment becomes the obstacle course itself.</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Step 6: Test Your Landmark</h2>\n        <p>This is the most important step. A landmark that looks great but plays poorly isn't meeting your goal.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"instruction-block\">\n            <p><strong>Playtest your creation:</strong></p>\n            <ol>\n                <li>Click the <strong>Play</strong> button in the Test section</li>\n                <li>When your character spawns, navigate to your landmark</li>\n                <li>Try to jump through the obstacles you created</li>\n                <li>Ask yourself: Is this fun?

First test: identify major issues (impossible jumps). Second test: refine difficulty (too easy or hard). Third test: polish experience (does it feel fun?). Don't skip testing—this is where good levels become great ones.</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Step 7: Organize Your Landmark</h2>\n        <p>As you build, your Explorer gets cluttered.

Let's explore different types of challenges you can create with basic parts.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"obstacle-ideas\">\n            <p><strong>Moving platforms:</strong> For now, just parts to jump across—you'll add movement with scripting in Star 4</p>\n            <p><strong>Narrow ledges:</strong> Long, thin parts (like <code>10, 1, 2</code>) that require careful landing</p>\n            <p><strong>Spiral paths:</strong> Platforms arranged in a circle, ascending around a central structure</p>\n            <p><strong>Gaps with visual hints:</strong> Large gaps with decorative parts showing where to jump</p>\n            <p><strong>Tiered challenges:</strong> An easy route and a hard route, letting players choose difficulty</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"try-it-box\">\n            <h3>Try It: Add One Advanced Obstacle</h3>\n            <p>Choose one of the obstacle types above and add it to your landmark. Test it. Does it work? Is it fun? Even if you end up removing it, the practice of experimenting with different obstacle types is valuable. Game design improves through experimentation.</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Connecting Landmarks to Environment</h2>\n        <p>Your landmark shouldn't feel like it's floating in space—it should feel integrated with the island terrain around it.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"instruction-block\">\n            <p><strong>Integration techniques:</strong></p>\n            <ol>\n                <li>Make sure your landmark sits properly on the terrain (not floating above or sunk below)</li>\n                <li>Use the same or similar materials as nearby terrain to create visual cohesion</li>\n                <li>Add a few decorative parts around the landmark (rocks, plants, paths) to blend it in</li>\n                <li>Ensure the landmark's scale feels appropriate relative to the terrain</li>\n            </ol>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Common Landmark Design Mistakes</h2>\n        <div class=\"troubleshooting\">\n            <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> Making every platform the exact same size and shape.</p>\n            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Vary your platform dimensions. Some can be large and safe, others small and challenging. Some can be round, others rectangular. Variety creates interest.</p>\n\n            <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> Creating jumps that are only possible with perfect timing.</p>\n            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Unless you're intentionally creating an expert challenge, make jumps forgiving. Slightly bigger platforms and slightly shorter gaps make gameplay more accessible without feeling too easy.</p>\n\n            <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> Building the landmark too large or too small relative to the character.</p>\n            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Test early and often. Run around your landmark with the character. Does it feel like a place a person could actually navigate? Scale issues are easier to fix early than after you've built 50 parts.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"mission-check\">\n        <h2>Mission Check</h2>\n        <p>Verify your landmark is ready before proceeding:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Built a structure recognizable as your chosen real-world landmark</li>\n            <li>Created at least 3 distinct obstacles or platforms that require jumping/navigation</li>\n            <li>Tested the landmark by actually playing through it with your character</li>\n            <li>Adjusted obstacles based on testing (made jumps possible and reasonably fun)</li>\n            <li>Organized all landmark parts into a named folder in the Explorer</li>\n            <li>Landmark feels integrated with the surrounding island terrain</li>\n            <li>You're proud of it—it represents both the real place and a fun gameplay challenge</li>\n        </ul>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"mission-bridge\">\n        <h2>Next Mission Preview</h2>\n        <p>You have a landmark.

The middle can introduce mild challenges (small jumps, narrow sections). Near the landmark, you can increase difficulty as a transition into the landmark's obstacles.

The quotation marks tell Lua \"this is text, not code\"</li>\n            <li><strong>)</strong> - The closing parenthesis ends the function's instructions</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>Think of it like this: You're asking Lua to print something, and inside the parentheses, you tell it exactly what to print.</p>\n\n        <h2>Step 3: Customize Your Message</h2>\n        <p>Let's make this script your own! Change the message to something personal:</p>\n\n        <div class=\"code-example\">\n            <pre><code>print(\"Welcome to my island runner!\")\nprint(\"Get ready for an adventure!\")\nprint(\"Created by [Your Name]\")</code></pre>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"try-it\">\n            <h3>Try It: Multiple Messages</h3>\n            <p>Notice how we have three different print statements? Each one is its own line of code. Try adding your own messages! You can print anything you want - song lyrics, jokes, facts about yourself. Just remember to keep the text inside quotation marks.</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Step 4: Find the Output Window</h2>\n        <p>Now comes the exciting part - seeing your code work!</p>\n\n        <ol>\n            <li>At the top of Roblox Studio, click the <strong>View</strong> tab</li>\n            <li>Click <strong>Output</strong> to open the Output window (if it's not already visible)</li>\n            <li>The Output window usually appears at the bottom of your screen</li>\n        </ol>\n\n        <div class=\"info-box\">\n            <h3>The Output Window is Your Best Friend</h3>\n            <p>Seriously. Every coder - beginner or expert - relies on the Output window. It's where you see messages from your code, and more importantly, it's where you see error messages that help you fix problems. Get comfortable with this window!</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Step 5: Run Your Code</h2>\n        <p>Time to see your code in action!</p>\n\n        <ol>\n            <li>Click the <strong>Play</strong> button at the top of Roblox Studio (the blue arrow)</li>\n            <li>Look at the <strong>Output</strong> window</li>\n            <li>You should see your messages appear!</li>\n        </ol>\n\n        <p>It should look something like this:</p>\n\n        <div class=\"code-example\">\n            <pre><code>Welcome to my island runner!\nGet ready for an adventure!\nCreated by Alex</code></pre>\n        </div>\n\n        <p>CONGRATULATIONS!

When your alarm goes off in the morning, you wake up. When someone knocks on a door, you answer it. When you touch a hot stove, you pull your hand back fast!</p>\n\n        <p>These are all <strong>events</strong> - things that happen that trigger a response. In coding, events work the same way:</p>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>Event happens:</strong> Player touches a part</li>\n            <li><strong>Code responds:</strong> Something happens in your game</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>Roblox has tons of built-in events: Touched, Clicked, CharacterAdded, Died, and many more. Today, we're focusing on the most useful one: <strong>Touched</strong>.</p>\n\n        <h2>Step 1: Create a Test Part</h2>\n        <p>First, let's create a part that we can interact with:</p>\n\n        <ol>\n            <li>In the <strong>Workspace</strong>, create a new <strong>Part</strong></li>\n            <li>Rename it to <strong>TouchPart</strong></li>\n            <li>Change its color to bright green so it stands out</li>\n            <li>Position it somewhere your player can easily reach (on the ground near your spawn)</li>\n            <li>Make it a bit bigger so it's easy to touch - try size (10, 2, 10)</li>\n        </ol>\n\n        <div class=\"info-box\">\n            <h3>Why a Test Part?</h3>\n            <p>Professional developers always test new code with simple examples first. Once you understand how Touched events work with this test part, you can apply the same code to checkpoints, power-ups, doors, and anything else you can imagine!</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Step 2: Add a Script to Your Part</h2>\n        <p>Here's something new: instead of putting the script in ServerScriptService, we're going to put it <em>inside the part itself</em>.</p>\n\n        <ol>\n            <li>In the <strong>Explorer</strong>, find your <strong>TouchPart</strong></li>\n            <li>Right-click on <strong>TouchPart</strong></li>\n            <li>Select <strong>Insert Object</strong> > <strong>Script</strong></li>\n            <li>Rename the script to <strong>TouchDetector</strong></li>\n        </ol>\n\n        <p>Now your TouchPart has its own personal script! The script can access the part it's inside using a special keyword called <code>script.Parent</code>.</p>\n\n        <h2>Step 3: Write Your First Event Code</h2>\n        <p>Double-click your TouchDetector script and replace everything with this code:</p>\n\n        <div class=\"code-example\">\n            <pre><code>local part = script.Parent\n\npart.Touched:Connect(function()\n    print(\"Something touched me!\")\nend)</code></pre>\n        </div>\n\n        <p>Whoa! That's more complex than our simple print statements. Let's break down EVERY single line:</p>\n\n        <h3>Line by Line Explanation</h3>\n\n        <h4>Line 1: <code>local part = script.Parent</code></h4>\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>local</strong> - Creates a variable that only exists in this script</li>\n            <li><strong>part</strong> - The name we're giving to our variable (we could call it anything)</li>\n            <li><strong>=</strong> - Assigns a value to the variable</li>\n            <li><strong>script.Parent</strong> - Refers to the object containing this script (our TouchPart)</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>Think of this like creating a nickname. Instead of typing \"script.Parent\" every time, we can just type \"part\". It's shorter and easier to read!</p>\n\n        <h4>Line 3: <code>part.Touched:Connect(function()</code></h4>\n        <p>This line does A LOT. Let's break it into pieces:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>part.Touched</strong> - The Touched event of our part</li>\n            <li><strong>:Connect</strong> - Connects our code to that event (like plugging in a cord)</li>\n            <li><strong>function()</strong> - Creates a function (a block of code) that will run when the event fires</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>In plain English: \"When something touches this part, run the code I'm about to give you.\"</p>\n\n        <h4>Line 4: <code>print(\"Something touched me!\")</code></h4>\n        <p>This is the code that runs when the event fires. You already know print() from the last mission!</p>\n\n        <h4>Line 5: <code>end)</code></h4>\n        <p>This closes both the function AND the Connect(). Every <code>function()</code> needs an <code>end</code>, and every opening parenthesis needs a closing one.</p>\n\n        <h2>Step 4: Test Your Code</h2>\n        <ol>\n            <li>Make sure the <strong>Output</strong> window is visible</li>\n            <li>Click the <strong>Play</strong> button</li>\n            <li>Walk your character into the green TouchPart</li>\n            <li>Watch the Output window!</li>\n        </ol>\n\n        <p>You should see \"Something touched me!\" appear multiple times! Why multiple times? Because as you walk through the part, different parts of your character touch it - your legs, your torso, maybe your arms. Each touch fires the event!</p>\n\n        <div class=\"try-it\">\n            <h3>Try It: Add More Messages</h3>\n            <p>Inside the function (between <code>function()</code> and <code>end</code>), you can add as many lines of code as you want! Try this:</p>\n            <div class=\"code-example\">\n                <pre><code>part.Touched:Connect(function()\n    print(\"Something touched me!\")\n    print(\"I can feel that!\")\n    print(\"This is so cool!\")\nend)</code></pre>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Step 5: Make It More Useful - Detect What Touched</h2>\n        <p>Right now, our code fires when ANYTHING touches the part - players, other parts, even falling debris. Let's make it smarter by detecting exactly what touched it.</p>\n\n        <p>Update your code to this:</p>\n\n        <div class=\"code-example\">\n            <pre><code>local part = script.Parent\n\npart.Touched:Connect(function(hit)\n    print(\"Something called \" .. hit.Name .. \" touched me!\")\nend)</code></pre>\n        </div>\n\n        <h3>What Changed?</h3>\n\n        <h4><code>function(hit)</code> instead of <code>function()</code></h4>\n        <p>We added a <strong>parameter</strong> called <code>hit</code>. When the Touched event fires, it automatically sends information about what touched the part. By putting <code>hit</code> in the parentheses, we can access that information!</p>\n\n        <p><code>hit</code> is the actual part that touched our TouchPart. If a player touches it, <code>hit</code> is part of their character (like their leg or torso).</p>\n\n        <h4><code>.. hit.Name ..</code></h4>\n        <p>The <code>..</code> operator combines text (we call this \"concatenation\"). This line combines three pieces:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>\"Something called \"</li>\n            <li>The name of whatever touched the part</li>\n            <li>\" touched me!\"</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>Test it now! You'll see messages like \"Something called Left Leg touched me!\" or \"Something called Right Leg touched me!\"</p>\n\n        <h2>Step 6: Detect Players Specifically</h2>\n        <p>Let's make our code even smarter - let's detect when a PLAYER touches the part and print their username!</p>\n\n        <div class=\"code-example\">\n            <pre><code>local part = script.Parent\n\npart.Touched:Connect(function(hit)\n    local humanoid = hit.Parent:FindFirstChild(\"Humanoid\")\n\n    if humanoid then\n        local player = game.Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(hit.Parent)\n        if player then\n            print(player.Name .. \" touched the part!\")\n        end\n    end\nend)</code></pre>\n        </div>\n\n        <p>Okay, this is getting more advanced! Let's break it down:</p>\n\n        <h3>Understanding the Logic</h3>\n\n        <h4>Finding the Humanoid</h4>\n        <p><code>local humanoid = hit.Parent:FindFirstChild(\"Humanoid\")</code></p>\n        <p>Every player character has a special object called a Humanoid. This line looks for it. If we find a Humanoid, we know something with a character touched the part (not just a random brick).</p>\n\n        <h4>The if Statement</h4>\n        <p><code>if humanoid then</code></p>\n        <p>This checks: \"Did we find a Humanoid?\" If yes, run the code inside. If no, skip it.</p>\n\n        <h4>Getting the Player</h4>\n        <p><code>local player = game.Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(hit.Parent)</code></p>\n        <p>This gets the actual player object from the character. The player object has useful info like their username!</p>\n\n        <h4>Printing the Username</h4>\n        <p><code>print(player.Name .. \" touched the part!\")</code></p>\n        <p>Now we print their actual username!</p>\n\n        <div class=\"try-it\">\n            <h3>Make It Fun!</h3>\n            <p>Try changing the message to something fun:</p>\n            <ul>\n                <li>\"Welcome, \" .. player.Name .. \"! Ready to run?\"</li>\n                <li>player.Name .. \" has entered the game zone!\"</li>\n                <li>\"Hey \" .. player.Name .. \", watch your step!\"</li>\n            </ul>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Step 7: Add Visual Feedback</h2>\n        <p>Let's make the part change color when touched! Add this line inside the innermost if statement:</p>\n\n        <div class=\"code-example\">\n            <pre><code>local part = script.Parent\n\npart.Touched:Connect(function(hit)\n    local humanoid = hit.Parent:FindFirstChild(\"Humanoid\")\n\n    if humanoid then\n        local player = game.Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(hit.Parent)\n        if player then\n            print(player.Name .. \" touched the part!\")\n            part.BrickColor = BrickColor.new(\"Bright blue\")\n        end\n    end\nend)</code></pre>\n        </div>\n\n        <p>Now when a player touches it, the part turns blue! This gives players immediate visual feedback.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"try-it\">\n            <h3>Experiment Time!</h3>\n            <ul>\n                <li>Try different colors: \"Bright red\", \"Really red\", \"Hot pink\", \"Lime green\"</li>\n                <li>Add <code>part.Material = Enum.Material.Neon</code> to make it glow!</li>\n                <li>Try <code>part.Transparency = 0.5</code> to make it half-transparent</li>\n            </ul>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Common Mistakes and Fixes</h2>\n\n        <div class=\"troubleshooting\">\n            <h3>Problem: Nothing happens when I touch the part</h3>\n            <p><strong>Solutions:</strong></p>\n            <ul>\n                <li>Make sure the script is inside the part, not in ServerScriptService</li>\n                <li>Check that the part is NOT anchored (uncheck Anchored in Properties) - wait, actually for this to work the part should be Anchored! Check both ways to see what works for your setup</li>\n                <li>Verify the Output window is open so you can see messages</li>\n                <li>Check for red error messages in Output</li>\n            </ul>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"troubleshooting\">\n            <h3>Problem: The message prints dozens of times</h3>\n            <p><strong>This is normal!</strong> As you walk through the part, different body parts touch it repeatedly.

Almost everything in games is based on events:</p>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li>Checkpoints? Touched events.</li>\n            <li>Collectible coins? Touched events.</li>\n            <li>Buttons and doors? Touched events (or Clicked events).</li>\n            <li>Damage zones? Touched events.</li>\n            <li>Finish lines?

Rename it to <strong>CheckpointScript</strong>.</p>\n\n        <p>Here's the complete checkpoint code:</p>\n\n        <div class=\"code-example\">\n            <pre><code>local checkpoint = script.Parent\nlocal debounce = {}\n\ncheckpoint.Touched:Connect(function(hit)\n    local humanoid = hit.Parent:FindFirstChild(\"Humanoid\")\n\n    if humanoid then\n        local player = game.Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(hit.Parent)\n\n        if player and not debounce[player] then\n            debounce[player] = true\n\n            -- Set this checkpoint as the player's spawn point\n            player.RespawnLocation = checkpoint\n\n            -- Visual feedback\n            checkpoint.BrickColor = BrickColor.new(\"Bright green\")\n            checkpoint.Material = Enum.Material.Neon\n\n            -- Print confirmation\n            print(player.Name .. \" reached checkpoint!\")\n\n            wait(2)\n            debounce[player] = nil\n        end\n    end\nend)</code></pre>\n        </div>\n\n        <p>Whoa! That's a lot of new stuff. Let's break down every single part:</p>\n\n        <h3>Line by Line Breakdown</h3>\n\n        <h4>Lines 1-2: Setup</h4>\n        <div class=\"code-example\">\n            <pre><code>local checkpoint = script.Parent\nlocal debounce = {}</code></pre>\n        </div>\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>checkpoint</strong> - References the SpawnLocation this script is inside</li>\n            <li><strong>debounce = {}</strong> - Creates an empty table (like a list) to track which players recently touched the checkpoint</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <h4>Lines 4-9: Detect Player Touch</h4>\n        <p>This part should look familiar from Mission 4.2! We detect when something touches the checkpoint, check if it has a Humanoid, then get the player.</p>\n\n        <h4>Line 11: The Debounce Check</h4>\n        <div class=\"code-example\">\n            <pre><code>if player and not debounce[player] then</code></pre>\n        </div>\n        <p>This checks TWO things:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>player</strong> - Did we successfully find a player?</li>\n            <li><strong>not debounce[player]</strong> - Is this player NOT in our debounce table? (Meaning they haven't touched this checkpoint recently)</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>This prevents the checkpoint from activating multiple times in a row!</p>\n\n        <h4>Line 12: Add to Debounce</h4>\n        <div class=\"code-example\">\n            <pre><code>debounce[player] = true</code></pre>\n        </div>\n        <p>We add this player to the debounce table, marking that they just touched the checkpoint.</p>\n\n        <h4>Line 15: The Magic Line</h4>\n        <div class=\"code-example\">\n            <pre><code>player.RespawnLocation = checkpoint</code></pre>\n        </div>\n        <p>THIS is what makes the checkpoint work! We set this player's RespawnLocation to this checkpoint. Now when they die, they'll respawn here instead of at the start!</p>\n\n        <h4>Lines 18-19: Visual Feedback</h4>\n        <p>We change the checkpoint to bright green and make it glow so players know they activated it. Visual feedback is SUPER important for good game design!</p>\n\n        <h4>Line 22: Confirmation Message</h4>\n        <p>Print a message so we can verify it's working.</p>\n\n        <h4>Lines 24-25: Reset Debounce</h4>\n        <div class=\"code-example\">\n            <pre><code>wait(2)\ndebounce[player] = nil</code></pre>\n        </div>\n        <p>Wait 2 seconds, then remove the player from the debounce table. Now they can activate the checkpoint again if needed (like if they run back and forth).</p>\n\n        <h2>Step 4: Test Your Checkpoint</h2>\n        <ol>\n            <li>Click <strong>Play</strong></li>\n            <li>Run over to your checkpoint</li>\n            <li>Watch it turn green and glow!</li>\n            <li>Now jump off your island (or walk into a dangerous area if you have one)</li>\n            <li>When you respawn, you should appear at the checkpoint, not at the original spawn!</li>\n        </ol>\n\n        <p>SUCCESS! You just created a working checkpoint system!</p>\n\n        <h2>Step 5: Add More Checkpoints</h2>\n        <p>One checkpoint is good, but a real runner game needs several! Here's how to add more:</p>\n\n        <ol>\n            <li>Select your <strong>Checkpoint1</strong> (including the script inside it)</li>\n            <li>Press <strong>Ctrl+D</strong> (or Cmd+D on Mac) to duplicate it</li>\n            <li>Rename it to <strong>Checkpoint2</strong></li>\n            <li>Move it further along your island path</li>\n            <li>Repeat for <strong>Checkpoint3</strong>, <strong>Checkpoint4</strong>, etc.</li>\n        </ol>\n\n        <p>The great news? Since you duplicated the checkpoint WITH the script, all your checkpoints will automatically work!</p>\n\n        <div class=\"try-it\">\n            <h3>Design Challenge!</h3>\n            <p>Place checkpoints strategically along your island:</p>\n            <ul>\n                <li>After difficult jumps</li>\n                <li>Before dangerous areas</li>\n                <li>At the start of each major section</li>\n                <li>NOT too close together (that's too easy!)</li>\n                <li>NOT too far apart (that's too frustrating!)</li>\n            </ul>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Step 6: Add Checkpoint Numbers (Optional but Cool)</h2>\n        <p>Let's track which checkpoint number the player reached! This teaches you about leaderstats - a way to display player stats on the leaderboard.</p>\n\n        <p>Create a new Script in <strong>ServerScriptService</strong> called <strong>LeaderboardSetup</strong>:</p>\n\n        <div class=\"code-example\">\n            <pre><code>game.Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(player)\n    local leaderstats = Instance.new(\"Folder\")\n    leaderstats.Name = \"leaderstats\"\n    leaderstats.Parent = player\n\n    local checkpointReached = Instance.new(\"IntValue\")\n    checkpointReached.Name = \"Checkpoint\"\n    checkpointReached.Value = 0\n    checkpointReached.Parent = leaderstats\nend)</code></pre>\n        </div>\n\n        <h3>What This Does</h3>\n        <p>When a player joins the game, this code:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Creates a \"leaderstats\" folder (special name that makes stats show on the leaderboard)</li>\n            <li>Creates an IntValue (integer/number value) called \"Checkpoint\"</li>\n            <li>Sets it to 0 initially</li>\n            <li>Puts it in the leaderstats folder</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>Now when you play, you'll see a \"Checkpoint: 0\" stat on the leaderboard!</p>\n\n        <h2>Step 7: Update Checkpoints to Track Numbers</h2>\n        <p>Let's make each checkpoint update this stat! Add this to your checkpoint script (inside the main if statement, after setting the RespawnLocation):</p>\n\n        <div class=\"code-example\">\n            <pre><code>-- Update checkpoint stat\nlocal leaderstats = player:FindFirstChild(\"leaderstats\")\nif leaderstats then\n    local checkpointStat = leaderstats:FindFirstChild(\"Checkpoint\")\n    if checkpointStat then\n        -- Only update if this checkpoint is higher than current\n        local checkpointNumber = tonumber(checkpoint.Name:match(\"%d+\"))\n        if checkpointNumber and checkpointNumber > checkpointStat.Value then\n            checkpointStat.Value = checkpointNumber\n        end\n    end\nend</code></pre>\n        </div>\n\n        <h3>Breaking Down the New Code</h3>\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>checkpoint.Name:match(\"%d+\")</strong> - Extracts the number from the checkpoint name (\"Checkpoint1\" → \"1\")</li>\n            <li><strong>tonumber()</strong> - Converts the text \"1\" into the actual number 1</li>\n            <li><strong>checkpointNumber > checkpointStat.Value</strong> - Only update if this is a NEW checkpoint (prevents going backwards)</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>Now when you touch checkpoints, the leaderboard updates to show which checkpoint you've reached!</p>\n\n        <div class=\"try-it\">\n            <h3>Make It Your Own!</h3>\n            <p>Customize your checkpoints:</p>\n            <ul>\n                <li>Use different colors for each checkpoint (rainbow checkpoints!)</li>\n                <li>Add a sound effect when activated (insert a Sound object into the checkpoint)</li>\n                <li>Make the checkpoint play a particle effect</li>\n                <li>Add a TextLabel above the checkpoint showing its number</li>\n            </ul>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Common Problems and Solutions</h2>\n\n        <div class=\"troubleshooting\">\n            <h3>Problem: I still respawn at the original spawn</h3>\n            <p><strong>Solutions:</strong></p>\n            <ul>\n                <li>Make sure you touched the checkpoint BEFORE dying</li>\n                <li>Check that the script is inside the checkpoint part</li>\n                <li>Verify there are no errors in the Output window</li>\n                <li>Make sure the checkpoint is a SpawnLocation, not just a regular Part</li>\n            </ul>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"troubleshooting\">\n            <h3>Problem: The checkpoint doesn't turn green</h3>\n            <p><strong>Solutions:</strong></p>\n            <ul>\n                <li>Check if the player detection is working (look for the print message in Output)</li>\n                <li>Make sure the visual feedback code is inside the if statement</li>\n                <li>Verify you're testing with a player character, not just the camera</li>\n            </ul>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"troubleshooting\">\n            <h3>Problem: The checkpoint stat doesn't update</h3>\n            <p><strong>Solutions:</strong></p>\n            <ul>\n                <li>Make sure the LeaderboardSetup script is in ServerScriptService</li>\n                <li>Check that your checkpoints are named with numbers (Checkpoint1, Checkpoint2, etc.)</li>\n                <li>Look for errors in the Output window</li>\n            </ul>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Understanding Debounce (The Cooldown System)</h2>\n        <p>Let's talk more about why debounce is so important:</p>\n\n        <p><strong>Without debounce:</strong> As you walk across the checkpoint, your character's legs, torso, and arms all touch it separately. The Touched event fires maybe 20 times in one second! Your code runs 20 times, the checkpoint changes color 20 times, and everything goes crazy.</p>\n\n        <p><strong>With debounce:</strong> The first touch activates the checkpoint. We add the player to the debounce table. For the next 2 seconds, any additional touches are ignored because the player is in the debounce table. After 2 seconds, we remove them from the table so they can activate it again if needed.</p>\n\n        <p>This is a professional coding technique used in every major game!</p>\n\n        <div class=\"pro-tip\">\n            <h3>Pro Game Designer Tip</h3>\n            <p>Checkpoint placement is an art!

Go back to Mission 4.3 and make sure your checkpoints are working correctly.</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"troubleshooting\">\n            <h3>Problem: Other parts that touch the kill brick disappear</h3>\n            <p><strong>This is normal!</strong> The kill brick will destroy anything with a Humanoid. If you don't want this, add a check to only kill players specifically (check if a Player object exists).</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"troubleshooting\">\n            <h3>Problem: My character dies repeatedly even after leaving the kill brick</h3>\n            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> The Touched event might be firing multiple times. Add debounce (like we did in checkpoints) to prevent repeated deaths.</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>The Psychology of Death in Games</h2>\n        <p>Here's something cool to think about: death in games isn't bad! Death creates:</p>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>Stakes:</strong> If you can't fail, success doesn't feel good</li>\n            <li><strong>Learning:</strong> Players learn what NOT to do</li>\n            <li><strong>Tension:</strong> Danger makes the game exciting</li>\n            <li><strong>Accomplishment:</strong> Beating a hard section feels AMAZING because you could have failed</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>The key is making death feel FAIR. If players die and think \"That was my fault, I can do better next time,\" that's good game design. If they think \"That was cheap!\" or \"How was I supposed to avoid that?\" - that's bad design.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"pro-tip\">\n            <h3>Pro Game Designer Tip</h3>\n            <p>Watch other people play your game (siblings, friends, classmates). Don't help them! Just watch where they die and listen to their reactions. If they die in the same spot over and over and get frustrated, you might need to add a checkpoint or remove some hazards. If they die but immediately want to try again, you nailed the difficulty!</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"mission-check\">\n        <h2>Mission Check</h2>\n        <p>Before moving on, make sure you can:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Explain how Humanoid.Health controls character life</li>\n            <li>Create kill bricks that instantly eliminate players</li>\n            <li>Design kill zones that look visually dangerous</li>\n            <li>Test the death and respawn system with checkpoints</li>\n            <li>Create different types of hazards (lava, spikes, etc.)</li>\n            <li>Optionally: Create damage-over-time zones or add effects</li>\n            <li>Balance your game so it's challenging but fair</li>\n        </ul>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"mission-bridge\">\n        <h2>What's Next?</h2>\n        <p>Your island now has checkpoints that save progress and hazards that punish mistakes.

But great games need variety. If every zone feels the same, players get bored fast. Think about your favorite platformers—they keep introducing new challenges, new environments, new obstacles that make you think differently.</p>\n        <p>Your mission: build a second landmark zone that feels completely different from the first. If your first zone was all about precise jumps, maybe this one tests speed. If the first was wide and open, make this one tight and vertical. The goal is contrast—give players a fresh challenge that makes them adapt.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"mission-objective\">\n        <h2>Mission Objective</h2>\n        <p>Design and build Landmark Zone 2 with obstacles that create a distinct challenge from your first zone, then place a checkpoint at the end.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"mission-content-main\">\n        <h2>Planning Your Second Zone</h2>\n        <p>Before you build a single part, think about contrast. Open your game and run through Landmark Zone 1. What kind of challenge is it? Write down three words that describe it. Fast? Tight? Vertical? Easy? Technical?</p>\n\n        <p>Now, for Zone 2, pick the opposite. If Zone 1 was fast-paced with wide jumps, make Zone 2 slower with precision jumps. If Zone 1 was flat, make Zone 2 vertical. This contrast keeps players engaged and shows off your design skills.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"try-it-box\">\n            <h3>Try It: Zone Contrast Chart</h3>\n            <p>Fill this out before building:</p>\n            <ul>\n                <li><strong>Zone 1 is</strong>: [wide/narrow] [fast/slow] [flat/vertical] [easy/hard]</li>\n                <li><strong>Zone 2 will be</strong>: [opposite choices]</li>\n                <li><strong>Main obstacle type</strong>: [what players will do most]</li>\n            </ul>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Building Zone 2</h2>\n        <p>Start with the landing platform—the area where players arrive from Zone 1. Make it safe, no kill bricks here. This gives players a moment to see what's ahead and prepare.</p>\n\n        <p>Then build your obstacle sequence. Here are proven patterns you can use:</p>\n\n        <h3>Pattern 1: The Gauntlet</h3>\n        <p>A straight line of obstacles that tests timing. Place kill brick gaps every few studs, forcing players to jump repeatedly without pause. Start with easy gaps (4-5 studs) and gradually increase to harder ones (6-7 studs).</p>\n\n        <h3>Pattern 2: The Maze</h3>\n        <p>Create a path that turns and twists. Use walls to force players to navigate tight corners. Add kill bricks in corners to punish sloppy movement. This works great if Zone 1 was straight and open.</p>\n\n        <h3>Pattern 3: The Vertical Climb</h3>\n        <p>Stack platforms going upward. Players must jump from level to level, climbing higher. Mix in some platforms that are offset left or right, so it's not just straight up. Add kill bricks below each level—if you fall, you fall far.</p>\n\n        <h3>Pattern 4: The Parkour Line</h3>\n        <p>A series of small platforms (4x4 studs or smaller) that players must jump across. Space them so each jump is just barely possible. This creates high tension—one mistake and you're done.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"tips-box\">\n            <h3>Design Tips</h3>\n            <ul>\n                <li><strong>Length matters</strong>: Zone 2 should be slightly longer than Zone 1. Players have more skills now.</li>\n                <li><strong>Color code it</strong>: Use different colors than Zone 1. This helps players know they've progressed.</li>\n                <li><strong>Add landmarks</strong>: Build a cool structure or shape that makes this zone memorable. A tower, an arch, a giant sphere—something visual.</li>\n                <li><strong>Safe spots</strong>: Every 3-4 obstacles, add a larger platform where players can rest. This prevents frustration.</li>\n            </ul>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Building Your Obstacles</h2>\n        <p>Let's build a specific example: a gauntlet with increasing difficulty.</p>\n\n        <ol>\n            <li>Create the landing platform (10x10 studs, Material: SmoothPlastic, Color: a new color)</li>\n            <li>Anchor it and position it where Zone 1 ends</li>\n            <li>Build the first jump: Place a platform 5 studs away (easy first jump)</li>\n            <li>Add a kill brick between them (Part, set CanCollide to false, Color: bright red, add kill brick script)</li>\n            <li>Build the second jump: 5.5 studs away (slightly harder)</li>\n            <li>Add another kill brick</li>\n            <li>Continue this pattern, increasing gap size to 6, then 6.5 studs</li>\n            <li>After 4-5 jumps, add a larger rest platform</li>\n            <li>Build a second set of jumps with a different pattern—maybe diagonal instead of straight</li>\n        </ol>\n\n        <div class=\"try-it-box\">\n            <h3>Try It: The Difficulty Curve</h3>\n            <p>Run through your zone. Time yourself. If it takes less than 20 seconds, it might be too easy. If it takes more than 60 seconds, it might be too hard. Aim for 30-45 seconds for a skilled player.</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Adding Visual Interest</h2>\n        <p>Don't just make functional obstacles—make them cool to look at. Here are quick wins:</p>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>Shape variety</strong>: Not everything has to be a rectangular part. Use cylinders, spheres, wedges.</li>\n            <li><strong>Rotation</strong>: Rotate platforms at slight angles. A platform tilted 15 degrees is more interesting than a flat one.</li>\n            <li><strong>Size variation</strong>: Mix large platforms with small ones.

(If yes, that spot might be too hard)</li>\n            <li>Is there a moment where I don't know where to go next? (If yes, add visual guides)</li>\n            <li>Does it feel different from Zone 1? (If no, revise to increase contrast)</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>If you're dying too much, make jumps slightly shorter or add more safe platforms. If it's too easy, increase gaps or remove safe platforms. Testing and adjusting is how good levels get great.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"try-it-box\">\n            <h3>Try It: The Friend Test</h3>\n            <p>If possible, have a classmate play your zone.

Players are settling into your game's rhythm. They understand what you're about. Zone 3 is where many games fail—it's easy to run out of ideas and just repeat what worked before. But you're not building \"just another zone.\" You're building the midpoint, the place that determines whether players keep going or quit.</p>\n        <p>Zone 3 needs to surprise them. Not with randomness, but with something new that still feels like it belongs in your game. Maybe it's a new obstacle type. Maybe it's a dramatic visual change. Maybe it's a difficulty spike that demands mastery of skills learned in Zones 1 and 2.</p>\n        <p>Your mission: create a landmark zone that proves you have more tricks up your sleeve.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"mission-objective\">\n        <h2>Mission Objective</h2>\n        <p>Build Landmark Zone 3 with a new obstacle pattern or challenge type that feels fresh while maintaining connection to the overall game design.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"mission-content-main\">\n        <h2>The Innovation Challenge</h2>\n        <p>Before building, ask yourself: what haven't I done yet? Review Zones 1 and 2. Write down what obstacle types you've already used:</p>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li>Simple gaps between platforms?</li>\n            <li>Tight corridors?</li>\n            <li>Vertical climbs?</li>\n            <li>Small platform parkour?</li>\n            <li>Timed sequences?</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>Now pick something different. Here are ideas organized by what makes them unique:</p>\n\n        <h3>New Idea 1: The Spiral</h3>\n        <p>Build platforms that spiral upward around a central point. Players circle around as they climb. This creates a 3D navigation challenge—they need to understand where they are in space, not just move forward. Great if your previous zones were flat and linear.</p>\n\n        <h3>New Idea 2: The Choice Path</h3>\n        <p>Create a fork where two paths diverge. One path is shorter but harder (smaller platforms, bigger gaps). The other is longer but easier (larger platforms, more safe spots). Both paths lead to the same checkpoint. This introduces strategy—do you risk the hard path for speed or take the safe route?</p>\n\n        <h3>New Idea 3: The Descending Challenge</h3>\n        <p>Most zones go up or stay flat. What if this one goes down? Build a series of platforms that descend into a pit. The challenge: you can't see what's below until you jump. Requires trust and precision. Place the checkpoint at the bottom.</p>\n\n        <h3>New Idea 4: The Obstacle Course</h3>\n        <p>Instead of gaps between platforms, fill the space with obstacles to navigate around. Build walls that jut out, forcing players to walk around them. Add low barriers they must jump over. Create a confined path where precise movement matters more than big jumps.</p>\n\n        <h3>New Idea 5: The Size Shift</h3>\n        <p>Make this zone either much bigger or much smaller than previous zones. Huge platforms with massive gaps, or tiny platforms requiring pixel-perfect jumps. The scale change alone makes it feel new.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"try-it-box\">\n            <h3>Try It: Pick Your Innovation</h3>\n            <p>Choose ONE of the ideas above (or create your own). Write it down. Sketch a rough layout on paper or visualize it. The key: commit to making this zone feel different from Zones 1 and 2.</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Building with Purpose</h2>\n        <p>Let's build a specific example: The Spiral. This teaches 3D thinking and looks impressive.</p>\n\n        <h3>Step 1: Build the Center</h3>\n        <p>Create a large cylinder or tower that will be your spiral's center point. This is visual reference—players will see it and understand they're circling it. Make it tall (60+ studs) and anchor it.</p>\n\n        <h3>Step 2: Build the First Platform</h3>\n        <p>Create the landing platform where players arrive from Zone 2. Position it at the base of your central tower, offset to one side. Make it safe and large (10x10 studs).</p>\n\n        <h3>Step 3: Build the Spiral Path</h3>\n        <p>Now build platforms that circle the tower going upward:</p>\n\n        <ol>\n            <li>Create a platform 8 studs away from the first, rotated 45 degrees around the tower</li>\n            <li>Raise it 4 studs higher than the landing platform</li>\n            <li>Create the next platform, rotated another 45 degrees, 4 studs higher</li>\n            <li>Continue this pattern—each platform rotates around and goes up</li>\n            <li>After one full rotation (8 platforms), you should be about 32 studs higher</li>\n            <li>Build 2-3 full rotations total</li>\n        </ol>\n\n        <h3>Step 4: Add Kill Bricks</h3>\n        <p>Place kill brick parts in the gaps between spiral platforms. Make them large enough to catch falling players but small enough to be visible as danger. Use your kill brick script from Star 4.</p>\n\n        <h3>Step 5: Add the Checkpoint</h3>\n        <p>At the top of the spiral, build a large final platform and place your checkpoint. Make this platform big—players just did something hard and need space to celebrate.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"tips-box\">\n            <h3>Spiral Building Tips</h3>\n            <ul>\n                <li><strong>Consistent spacing</strong>: Keep rotation angle and height increase the same for each platform. This creates predictable rhythm.</li>\n                <li><strong>Platform size</strong>: Start with 6x6 platforms. If it's too easy, shrink to 5x5. If too hard, expand to 7x7.</li>\n                <li><strong>Visual guides</strong>: Add small parts or arrows pointing to the next platform. Players can get disoriented in 3D.</li>\n                <li><strong>Test the camera</strong>: The camera might fight you on spirals. Playtest to ensure players can see where they're going.</li>\n            </ul>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Alternative Build: The Choice Path</h2>\n        <p>If spirals aren't your style, here's how to build a choice path zone:</p>\n\n        <ol>\n            <li>Build the landing platform (10x10 studs)</li>\n            <li>Build two platforms ahead of it, positioned left and right (the fork)</li>\n            <li><strong>Left path (hard)</strong>: Build 8-10 small platforms (4x4 studs) with 6-7 stud gaps</li>\n            <li><strong>Right path (easy)</strong>: Build 12-15 larger platforms (7x7 studs) with 5 stud gaps</li>\n            <li>Both paths should take roughly the same time, just different skill levels</li>\n            <li>Build a final platform where both paths merge</li>\n            <li>Place checkpoint on the merge platform</li>\n            <li>Add kill bricks under all platforms</li>\n        </ol>\n\n        <p>The beauty of choice paths: they accommodate different skill levels. Struggling players take the easy route. Confident players challenge themselves with the hard route. Everyone wins.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"try-it-box\">\n            <h3>Try It: Signaling Choice</h3>\n            <p>If you build a choice path, make the choice obvious. Color the hard path red and easy path green. Or place signs using text labels. Players should know what they're choosing.</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Difficulty Calibration</h2>\n        <p>Zone 3 is your midpoint. It should be harder than Zones 1 and 2, but not brutal. Here's a calibration guide:</p>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>Zone 1</strong>: Takes 3-5 attempts for new players to complete</li>\n            <li><strong>Zone 2</strong>: Takes 5-8 attempts to complete</li>\n            <li><strong>Zone 3</strong>: Should take 8-12 attempts to complete</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>Test this yourself. Delete your checkpoint progress and run through from Zone 1 to Zone 3. Count your deaths in Zone 3. If you're dying 20+ times and you built it, players will struggle too much. Adjust.</p>\n\n        <h2>Visual Identity</h2>\n        <p>By Zone 3, players should see a visual progression. Each zone should have its own color scheme or style. This creates a sense of journey.</p>\n\n        <p>Ideas for Zone 3 visual identity:</p>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>Color theme</strong>: Pick a color palette you haven't used. If Zones 1-2 were blues and greens, try oranges and purples.</li>\n            <li><strong>Material choice</strong>: Use a different material. If you've used SmoothPlastic, try Neon or Metal for Zone 3.</li>\n            <li><strong>Decorative elements</strong>: Add non-functional parts that look cool. Floating spheres, pillars, arches—things that create atmosphere.</li>\n            <li><strong>Lighting prep</strong>: While you won't add lighting until Star 6, build this zone thinking about it. Leave space for spotlights or ambient glow.</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <div class=\"tips-box\">\n            <h3>The Rule of Three</h3>\n            <p>In game design, three is a magic number. Players see two zones, they start to predict patterns. Three zones confirms those patterns. You're teaching players how your game works. Zone 1 introduces, Zone 2 reinforces, Zone 3 expands. Keep this rhythm in mind.</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Playtesting Protocol</h2>\n        <p>Testing Zone 3 requires fresh eyes. You've been building for a while—you know this zone too well. Here's how to test effectively:</p>\n\n        <ol>\n            <li><strong>Wait 10 minutes</strong>: After building, take a break. Get water, stretch, do something else. Come back fresh.</li>\n            <li><strong>Full playthrough</strong>: Start from the spawn point, run through Zones 1, 2, and 3. Does Zone 3 feel like a natural progression or a sudden spike?</li>\n            <li><strong>Count deaths</strong>: Track where you die most. If one obstacle kills you 80% of the time, it's probably too hard.</li>\n            <li><strong>Check the clock</strong>: Time how long Zone 3 takes. Aim for 40-60 seconds for a successful run. If it's taking 90+ seconds, it might be too long.</li>\n            <li><strong>The fun test</strong>: Are you having fun? If running through your own zone feels like a chore, players will hate it. Good zones are fun even when you fail.</li>\n        </ol>\n\n        <div class=\"try-it-box\">\n            <h3>Try It: The Perspective Shift</h3>\n            <p>Playtest with different camera angles. Zoom in close, zoom out far. Does your zone work from all views? If it only works from one specific camera angle, that's a design flaw. Fix it.</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Common Zone 3 Mistakes</h2>\n        <p>Avoid these traps:</p>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>Too much innovation</strong>: Don't make Zone 3 completely alien. It should feel new but still part of the same game.</li>\n            <li><strong>Copying Zones 1-2</strong>: The opposite problem. If Zone 3 is just \"more of the same,\" players will check out mentally.</li>\n            <li><strong>Difficulty spike</strong>: Making Zone 3 way harder than Zone 2 frustrates players. Ramp difficulty gradually.</li>\n            <li><strong>Visual chaos</strong>: Adding too many decorations or colors. Keep it clean and readable.</li>\n            <li><strong>Unclear path</strong>: Players should always know where to go next. If they're confused, add visual guides.</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <h2>Final Checks</h2>\n        <p>Before moving on, verify:</p>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li>Zone 3 introduces something new (pattern, visual style, or challenge type)</li>\n            <li>All parts are anchored</li>\n            <li>Kill bricks are scripted and CanCollide = false</li>\n            <li>Checkpoint is placed and working</li>\n            <li>You can complete Zones 1-3 in sequence without game-breaking bugs</li>\n            <li>Zone 3 is harder than Zone 2 but not impossibly so</li>\n            <li>Visual style is distinct from previous zones</li>\n        </ul>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"mission-check\">\n        <h2>Mission Check</h2>\n        <p>Before proceeding, verify:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Landmark Zone 3 is built with a new obstacle pattern or challenge type</li>\n            <li>Zone maintains visual and gameplay connection to Zones 1-2</li>\n            <li>Checkpoint is placed and functional at zone end</li>\n            <li>Zone difficulty is calibrated (harder than Zone 2, not brutal)</li>\n            <li>You can complete all three zones in sequence</li>\n            <li>Zone has distinct visual identity (color, materials, or style)</li>\n        </ul>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"mission-bridge\">\n        <h2>What's Next</h2>\n        <p>Three zones down, and your island runner is taking shape.

Lower = faster, higher = slower:</p>\n\n        <div class=\"code-block\">\n<pre>local tweenInfo = TweenInfo.new(\n    2,  -- Faster (2 seconds instead of 3)\n    -- ... rest stays the same\n)\n</pre>\n        </div>\n\n        <h3>Changing Easing Style</h3>\n        <p>Easing style changes how movement feels. Try these options:</p>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><code>Enum.EasingStyle.Linear</code> - Constant speed (current setting)</li>\n            <li><code>Enum.EasingStyle.Sine</code> - Smooth, gentle motion</li>\n            <li><code>Enum.EasingStyle.Bounce</code> - Bounces at the end</li>\n            <li><code>Enum.EasingStyle.Elastic</code> - Rubber band effect</li>\n            <li><code>Enum.EasingStyle.Quad</code> - Accelerates and decelerates</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <div class=\"try-it-box\">\n            <h3>Try It: Experiment with Easing</h3>\n            <p>Change the EasingStyle to Bounce or Elastic. Play the game. The movement feels completely different. Choose styles that match your zone's feel—smooth for calm zones, bouncy for chaotic zones.</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Building a Moving Platform Challenge</h2>\n        <p>One moving platform is cool. Multiple moving platforms create a challenge. Here's how to design a sequence:</p>\n\n        <h3>Pattern 1: The Conveyor</h3>\n        <p>Create 3-4 platforms that all move horizontally in the same direction, but staggered so they're never all in the same position at once. Players must jump from platform to platform as they move.</p>\n\n        <ol>\n            <li>Create 4 platforms, space them 10 studs apart</li>\n            <li>Give each the same movement script (moving 20 studs horizontally)</li>\n            <li>Start each platform at a different point in its cycle (we'll do this with delay)</li>\n        </ol>\n\n        <p>To stagger the start times, add a wait before playing the tween:</p>\n\n        <div class=\"code-block\">\n<pre>-- Add this BEFORE tweenForward:Play()\nwait(0)  -- First platform: no delay\n-- For second platform script, use: wait(0.75)\n-- For third platform: wait(1.5)\n-- For fourth platform: wait(2.25)\n\ntweenForward:Play()\n</pre>\n        </div>\n\n        <h3>Pattern 2: The Elevator</h3>\n        <p>Create platforms that move vertically at different speeds, creating a climbing challenge.</p>\n\n        <ol>\n            <li>Build 3 platforms vertically stacked</li>\n            <li>First platform: moves up 10 studs in 4 seconds</li>\n            <li>Second platform: moves up 15 studs in 3 seconds (faster)</li>\n            <li>Third platform: moves up 20 studs in 5 seconds (slower but farther)</li>\n        </ol>\n\n        <h3>Pattern 3: The Crossroads</h3>\n        <p>Create two sets of platforms that move perpendicular to each other (one horizontal, one vertical). Players must time jumps to avoid getting knocked off.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"tips-box\">\n            <h3>Design Tips for Moving Platforms</h3>\n            <ul>\n                <li><strong>Predictability</strong>: Players should be able to see the pattern. Don't make movement random.</li>\n                <li><strong>Safe spots</strong>: Include static platforms nearby where players can wait and observe movement.</li>\n                <li><strong>Visual distinction</strong>: Make moving platforms look different (color, material, or add trails/particles later).</li>\n                <li><strong>Test timing</strong>: Can you complete the sequence in under 30 seconds? If not, it's too slow or complex.</li>\n                <li><strong>Checkpoint placement</strong>: Put a checkpoint AFTER moving platform challenges, not before. They're hard—reward completion.</li>\n            </ul>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Advanced: Circular Motion</h2>\n        <p>Want platforms that move in circles? This requires a different approach using CFrame rotation:</p>\n\n        <div class=\"code-block\">\n<pre>-- Circular Moving Platform\nlocal platform = script.Parent\nlocal TweenService = game:GetService(\"TweenService\")\n\nlocal centerPoint = platform.CFrame  -- Center of rotation\nlocal radius = 15  -- How far from center\nlocal duration = 8  -- Seconds for one full rotation\n\n-- Create rotation tween\nlocal tweenInfo = TweenInfo.new(\n    duration,\n    Enum.EasingStyle.Linear,\n    Enum.EasingDirection.InOut,\n    -1,  -- Infinite loop\n    false,  -- Don't reverse\n    0\n)\n\n-- Rotate around Y axis\nfor i = 0, 360, 10 do\n    local angle = math.rad(i)\n    local offsetX = math.cos(angle) * radius\n    local offsetZ = math.sin(angle) * radius\n    local newPosition = centerPoint + Vector3.new(offsetX, 0, offsetZ)\n\n    platform.CFrame = newPosition\n    wait(duration / 36)  -- Smooth rotation\nend\n</pre>\n        </div>\n\n        <p>This script is more advanced—it uses math to calculate circular motion. You don't need to fully understand the math yet, but you can use it to create cool circular platform paths.</p>\n\n        <h2>Common Mistakes and Fixes</h2>\n\n        <h3>Mistake 1: Platform Not Moving</h3>\n        <p><strong>Problem</strong>: Platform stays still when you play the game.</p>\n        <p><strong>Fix</strong>: Check that the platform is anchored. Unanchored parts don't tween properly. Also verify the script is inside the platform part.</p>\n\n        <h3>Mistake 2: Platform Teleports Instead of Tweening</h3>\n        <p><strong>Problem</strong>: Platform jumps between positions instead of moving smoothly.</p>\n        <p><strong>Fix</strong>: Make sure you're using TweenService:Create correctly and calling :Play() on the tween. Double-check your code matches the examples.</p>\n\n        <h3>Mistake 3: Can't Stand on Moving Platform</h3>\n        <p><strong>Problem</strong>: Player slides off or doesn't move with the platform.</p>\n        <p><strong>Fix</strong>: This is normal Roblox behavior. For better platform riding, you can add AssemblyLinearVelocity, but that's advanced. For now, design jumps that don't require staying on the platform long.</p>\n\n        <h3>Mistake 4: Platforms Collide with Each Other</h3>\n        <p><strong>Problem</strong>: Multiple moving platforms bump into each other and stop.</p>\n        <p><strong>Fix</strong>: Set CanCollide to false on one or both platforms, OR space them farther apart so paths don't overlap.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"try-it-box\">\n            <h3>Try It: The Timing Challenge</h3>\n            <p>Build a sequence of three moving platforms. Time yourself jumping across all three. If it takes more than 15 seconds, players will get frustrated. Speed up the platforms or shorten the movement distance.</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Where to Add Moving Platforms</h2>\n        <p>You have three zones built. Where should moving platforms go? Here's guidance:</p>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>Zone 1</strong>: Probably skip. It's your intro zone—keep it simple.</li>\n            <li><strong>Zone 2</strong>: Good candidate if Zone 2 is currently easier than Zone 3.</li>\n            <li><strong>Zone 3</strong>: Best candidate. It's your midpoint—adding moving platforms here raises the stakes.</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>You don't need to replace the entire zone. Add moving platforms to one section—maybe replace 3-4 static platforms with moving ones. This creates variety within the zone itself.</p>\n\n        <h2>Playtesting Moving Platforms</h2>\n        <p>Moving platforms change everything about difficulty. Retest your zone after adding them:</p>\n\n        <ol>\n            <li>Can you complete the zone with moving platforms in under 1 minute?</li>\n            <li>Are the platforms moving too fast to jump onto? (If yes, increase duration)</li>\n            <li>Are they moving too slow and boring? (If yes, decrease duration)</li>\n            <li>Can you see the pattern and predict movement? (If no, slow them down or simplify)</li>\n            <li>Is it fun? Challenging but fair, not frustrating?</li>\n        </ol>\n\n        <div class=\"tips-box\">\n            <h3>The Fun Factor</h3>\n            <p>Moving platforms should feel like a dance, not a fight. Players should learn the rhythm, predict the motion, and feel skilled when they nail the timing. If it feels random or impossible, revise.</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Expanding Your Knowledge</h2>\n        <p>TweenService can animate any property, not just position:</p>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>Size</strong>: Make platforms grow and shrink</li>\n            <li><strong>Transparency</strong>: Make platforms fade in and out</li>\n            <li><strong>Color</strong>: Make platforms change color as they move</li>\n            <li><strong>Rotation</strong>: Make platforms spin</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>Example of tweening transparency (makes platform invisible):</p>\n\n        <div class=\"code-block\">\n<pre>local tweenInfo = TweenInfo.new(2, Enum.EasingStyle.Linear, Enum.EasingDirection.InOut, -1, true, 0)\nlocal tween = TweenService:Create(platform, tweenInfo, {Transparency = 1})  -- 1 = invisible\ntween:Play()\n</pre>\n        </div>\n\n        <p>Combining tweens—moving AND fading—creates really cool effects. Experiment after you finish the basic requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"mission-check\">\n        <h2>Mission Check</h2>\n        <p>Before proceeding, verify:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>You have at least 3 moving platforms in one of your zones</li>\n            <li>All moving platforms use TweenService (not while loops or manual movement)</li>\n            <li>Platforms move smoothly and predictably</li>\n            <li>You can complete the zone with moving platforms included</li>\n            <li>Scripts are properly attached to each moving platform</li>\n            <li>Movement patterns create a timing challenge, not a frustration</li>\n        </ul>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"mission-bridge\">\n        <h2>What's Next</h2>\n        <p>You've just added one of the most professional features to your game.

Hard but satisfying, brings ideas together.</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>This is classic game design structure. Players understand it intuitively. Zone 4 is where they sweat.

It should combine multiple challenge types from previous zones and add new complexity.</p>\n\n        <h3>Design Philosophy for Zone 4</h3>\n        <p>Don't just make it \"harder\" by making jumps impossible. Make it harder by making it complex—multiple things happening at once, longer sequences without breaks, tighter timing windows.</p>\n\n        <h3>Recommended Pattern: The Combination Zone</h3>\n        <p>Build Zone 4 using elements from all previous zones:</p>\n\n        <ol>\n            <li><strong>Opening</strong>: Start with a familiar pattern (like Zone 1's simple jumps) but faster/tighter</li>\n            <li><strong>Section 2</strong>: Add moving platforms (from Zone 3) in a harder configuration</li>\n            <li><strong>Section 3</strong>: Mix vertical and horizontal movement</li>\n            <li><strong>Section 4</strong>: Create a final test that requires precision</li>\n            <li><strong>Checkpoint</strong>: Place at the end as a huge relief moment</li>\n        </ol>\n\n        <h3>Specific Build Example: The Ascending Spiral with Moving Obstacles</h3>\n\n        <p>Here's a complete Zone 4 build you can follow or adapt:</p>\n\n        <ol>\n            <li><strong>Base platform</strong>: Large landing area (10x10 studs)</li>\n            <li><strong>Phase 1 - Speed test</strong>: Build 6 platforms in a line, gaps of 6.5 studs, forces quick jumping</li>\n            <li><strong>Phase 2 - Moving platforms</strong>: Add 4 moving platforms that go vertical (up/down), stagger their timing</li>\n            <li><strong>Rest platform</strong>: Medium safe platform for catching breath</li>\n            <li><strong>Phase 3 - Spiral climb</strong>: Build a spiral (like Zone 3) but with smaller platforms (5x5 instead of 6x6)</li>\n            <li><strong>Phase 4 - Final jump</strong>: Single hard jump to final platform (7 studs gap)</li>\n            <li><strong>Checkpoint platform</strong>: Large platform (12x12) with checkpoint part</li>\n        </ol>\n\n        <p>This design combines speed, timing (moving platforms), 3D navigation (spiral), and a climactic final jump.

Long hard zones need midpoint saves.</li>\n                <li><strong>Visual drama</strong>: Make it look intimidating. Use darker colors, bigger structures, more complex geometry.</li>\n                <li><strong>Fair difficulty</strong>: Hard doesn't mean impossible. Everything should be achievable with practice.</li>\n            </ul>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Building Zone 5: The Victory Lap</h2>\n        <p>Zone 5 is special. It's the ending. Players who reach it should feel accomplished, and the zone should deliver a satisfying conclusion.</p>\n\n        <h3>Design Philosophy for Zone 5</h3>\n        <p>Zone 5 should be hard—players earned the right to be challenged. But it shouldn't be harder than Zone 4. Think of it as \"Zone 4's difficulty but more fun\" or \"a celebration of everything you built.\"</p>\n\n        <h3>Recommended Pattern: The Greatest Hits</h3>\n        <p>Build Zone 5 as a showcase of your best obstacles from Zones 1-4, remixed in new ways:</p>\n\n        <ol>\n            <li>Take your favorite obstacle from Zone 1—rebuild it here but elevated</li>\n            <li>Take the coolest part of Zone 2—include a variation</li>\n            <li>Use moving platforms again, but in a new pattern</li>\n            <li>Add one final unique element—something you didn't do in Zones 1-4</li>\n        </ol>\n\n        <h3>Specific Build Example: The Grand Finale Path</h3>\n\n        <ol>\n            <li><strong>Entrance</strong>: Grand archway or structure signaling \"this is the end\"</li>\n            <li><strong>Section 1</strong>: Recreate your best static obstacle sequence from earlier zones</li>\n            <li><strong>Section 2</strong>: Moving platforms that create a rhythm challenge</li>\n            <li><strong>Section 3</strong>: A choice path (callback to Zone 3 if you built one, or new)</li>\n            <li><strong>Section 4</strong>: Final approach—a dramatic, climactic sequence (spiral to a peak, long jump sequence, etc.)</li>\n            <li><strong>Victory platform</strong>: Massive final platform with checkpoint and maybe decorative elements (trophies, sparkles, whatever feels victorious)</li>\n        </ol>\n\n        <div class=\"try-it-box\">\n            <h3>Try It: The Finale Element</h3>\n            <p>Add one thing to Zone 5 you haven't done yet.

This makes Zone 5 memorable.</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Maintaining Variety Across All Zones</h2>\n        <p>With five zones built, check for variety. Run through your entire game and ask:</p>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li>Does each zone feel different?</li>\n            <li>Are you using different colors/materials for each zone?</li>\n            <li>Do obstacles repeat too much, or is there good variation?</li>\n            <li>Can you describe each zone with a unique phrase? (\"The spiral zone,\" \"The moving platform zone,\" etc.)</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>If two zones feel too similar, revise one. Similarity breeds boredom.</p>\n\n        <h2>Difficulty Calibration Across All Zones</h2>\n        <p>Now that all five zones exist, playtest the ENTIRE game in one sitting. From spawn to Zone 5 checkpoint. Track this data:</p>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>Total completion time</strong>: Should be 4-7 minutes for a skilled player</li>\n            <li><strong>Death count per zone</strong>: Zone 1 (0-3 deaths), Zone 2 (3-6), Zone 3 (5-10), Zone 4 (10-15), Zone 5 (8-12)</li>\n            <li><strong>Frustration points</strong>: Any obstacle that kills you 5+ times is too hard—revise it</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>If your death counts are way higher, your game is too hard. Lower gaps, add safe platforms, or slow down moving platforms. If death counts are way lower, your game might be too easy. Increase challenge.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"tips-box\">\n            <h3>The 10-Minute Rule</h3>\n            <p>A complete run of your game (spawn to final checkpoint) should take 10-15 minutes for a new player, 4-7 minutes for a skilled player. If it's taking 30+ minutes, it's too long or too hard. Edit.</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Visual Progression</h2>\n        <p>Your zones should show visual progression. Here's a proven color/style progression:</p>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>Zone 1</strong>: Bright, simple colors (blues, greens) - feels safe and friendly</li>\n            <li><strong>Zone 2</strong>: Slightly darker or more saturated colors - feels more serious</li>\n            <li><strong>Zone 3</strong>: New color family (oranges, purples) - signals midpoint</li>\n            <li><strong>Zone 4</strong>: Dark, intense colors (reds, blacks) - feels dangerous</li>\n            <li><strong>Zone 5</strong>: Bright again, but different (golds, whites, neon) - feels triumphant</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>This creates an emotional journey through color alone. Players feel the progression even if they're not consciously noticing it.</p>\n\n        <h2>Adding Polish to Zones 4-5</h2>\n        <p>Since these are your final zones, add extra polish:</p>\n\n        <h3>Decorative Elements</h3>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Add non-functional parts that look cool (pillars, arches, floating shapes)</li>\n            <li>Use a variety of part shapes (not just rectangular blocks)</li>\n            <li>Add small details (small spheres, wedges, cylinders as accents)</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <h3>Size and Scale</h3>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Make Zone 4 feel big and imposing (larger structures, taller obstacles)</li>\n            <li>Make Zone 5 feel grand and expansive (wide platforms, open space)</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <h3>Scripting Polish</h3>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Make sure all moving platforms in Zones 4-5 have smooth, predictable motion</li>\n            <li>Test all checkpoints to ensure they save progress correctly</li>\n            <li>Verify all kill bricks kill instantly (CanCollide = false, script working)</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <div class=\"try-it-box\">\n            <h3>Try It: The Victory Moment</h3>\n            <p>At the end of Zone 5, after the checkpoint, add a finish zone trigger (like you built in Star 4). When players touch it, fire a message: \"You completed the Island Runner! Great job!\" This gives closure.</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Common Mistakes in Final Zones</h2>\n\n        <h3>Mistake 1: Difficulty Spike in Zone 5</h3>\n        <p>Making Zone 5 harder than Zone 4 frustrates players. They expect the hardest challenge earlier, not at the very end. Keep Zone 5 challenging but slightly easier than Zone 4.</p>\n\n        <h3>Mistake 2: Repetitive Design</h3>\n        <p>Zones 4-5 that feel identical to earlier zones. Always ask: \"What makes THIS zone special?\" If you can't answer, redesign.</p>\n\n        <h3>Mistake 3: Exhausting Length</h3>\n        <p>Making Zones 4-5 too long. Players are tired by this point. Long zones need midpoint checkpoints or shorter obstacle sequences.</p>\n\n        <h3>Mistake 4: Anticlimax</h3>\n        <p>Zone 5 ending abruptly with no celebration. Add a victory platform, a message, something that says \"You did it!\" Endings matter.</p>\n\n        <h2>Final Playtesting</h2>\n        <p>With all five zones complete, do a comprehensive playtest:</p>\n\n        <ol>\n            <li><strong>Full run</strong>: Complete the game from spawn to Zone 5 end. No skipping.</li>\n            <li><strong>Checkpoint test</strong>: Die intentionally in each zone, verify you respawn at correct checkpoints.</li>\n            <li><strong>Difficulty check</strong>: Does difficulty increase smoothly from Zone 1 to 4, then slightly decrease in 5?</li>\n            <li><strong>Visual check</strong>: Does each zone look distinct from the others?</li>\n            <li><strong>Fun check</strong>: Are you having fun? If you're bored or frustrated with your own game, players will be too.</li>\n        </ol>\n\n        <div class=\"tips-box\">\n            <h3>The Fresh Eyes Test</h3>\n            <p>If possible, have someone else play your complete game. Don't give instructions—just watch. Where do they get stuck? Where do they struggle? Where do they smile? Their experience reveals what you can't see anymore because you've tested it too much.</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Checkpoint Placement Strategy</h2>\n        <p>Review checkpoint placement across all zones:</p>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>Zone 1</strong>: One checkpoint at the end</li>\n            <li><strong>Zone 2</strong>: One checkpoint at the end</li>\n            <li><strong>Zone 3</strong>: One checkpoint at the end (or two if it's very long)</li>\n            <li><strong>Zone 4</strong>: Two checkpoints (midpoint and end) - it's the hardest</li>\n            <li><strong>Zone 5</strong>: One or two checkpoints depending on length</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>More checkpoints = easier. Fewer = harder. Balance this based on your difficulty goals.</p>\n\n        <h2>Preparing for the Next Star</h2>\n        <p>Once Zones 4-5 are built, you're done with world building. Next up: flow testing (Mission 5.5), where you'll refine the entire experience. After that, Star 6 covers polish—lighting, skyboxes, and final details.</p>\n\n        <p>Your game is nearly complete.

As you play, pause and write down every issue you encounter:</p>\n\n        <h3>Common Problems to Look For</h3>\n\n        <h4>1. Frustration Points</h4>\n        <p>An obstacle that kills you repeatedly without feeling fair. Characteristics:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>5+ deaths on the same obstacle</li>\n            <li>Success feels like luck, not skill</li>\n            <li>You can't see the solution or what you're doing wrong</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p><strong>Fix</strong>: Make the obstacle easier (shorter gap, larger platform), add visual guides, or add a safe platform before it so players can study it.</p>\n\n        <h4>2. Dead Zones</h4>\n        <p>Areas where nothing happens for too long. Characteristics:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Long stretches of walking with no challenge</li>\n            <li>Safe platforms that are too large or too long</li>\n            <li>Gaps between zones that feel empty</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p><strong>Fix</strong>: Shorten safe platforms, add small obstacles to \"dead\" areas, or tighten zone transitions.</p>\n\n        <h4>3. Confusion Points</h4>\n        <p>Places where you don't know where to go next. Characteristics:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Multiple paths and the correct one isn't obvious</li>\n            <li>Next platform is hidden or hard to see</li>\n            <li>Visual clutter makes navigation unclear</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p><strong>Fix</strong>: Add visual guides (bright colors, arrows, or lights pointing to the next platform), remove ambiguous paths, or improve sightlines.</p>\n\n        <h4>4. Pacing Issues</h4>\n        <p>Zones that feel too long, too short, or poorly timed. Characteristics:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>A zone takes 2+ minutes to complete (too long)</li>\n            <li>A zone takes less than 30 seconds (too short)</li>\n            <li>Difficulty spikes suddenly instead of ramping</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p><strong>Fix</strong>: Add or remove obstacles to adjust length. Insert easier obstacles between hard ones to smooth difficulty spikes.</p>\n\n        <h4>5. Technical Issues</h4>\n        <p>Bugs or scripting problems. Characteristics:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Checkpoint doesn't save progress</li>\n            <li>Kill brick doesn't kill</li>\n            <li>Moving platform glitches or moves incorrectly</li>\n            <li>Player falls through anchored platforms</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p><strong>Fix</strong>: Check scripts, verify properties (Anchored, CanCollide, etc.), and test each element individually.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"try-it-box\">\n            <h3>Try It: The Problem List</h3>\n            <p>Create a numbered list of every problem you find.

Here's how to run a good playtest:</p>\n\n        <h3>Playtest Protocol</h3>\n        <ol>\n            <li><strong>Don't give instructions</strong>: Just say \"try to reach the end.\" See if they figure it out.</li>\n            <li><strong>Don't help</strong>: Watch where they struggle but don't intervene. Their struggles show design flaws.</li>\n            <li><strong>Take notes</strong>: Write down where they die, where they get confused, where they quit.</li>\n            <li><strong>Ask questions after</strong>: \"What was most fun? Most frustrating? Did anything feel unfair?\"</li>\n        </ol>\n\n        <h3>Interpreting Feedback</h3>\n        <p>Not all feedback is useful, but patterns are:</p>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>One person struggles at spot X</strong>: Maybe they're not skilled. Monitor.</li>\n            <li><strong>Three people struggle at spot X</strong>: Spot X is too hard. Fix it.</li>\n            <li><strong>Someone says \"this is too easy\"</strong>: They might be skilled. Don't overreact.</li>\n            <li><strong>Someone quits in frustration</strong>: Big red flag. Find out exactly where and why, then fix it.</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <div class=\"tips-box\">\n            <h3>The Silent Playtest</h3>\n            <p>Watch someone play without talking. Don't explain, don't hint, don't coach. Just watch. You'll learn more in five minutes of silent observation than in an hour of explanation. Their confusion is your design talking.</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Difficulty Curve Visualization</h2>\n        <p>After your five runs and fixes, create a final difficulty curve visualization:</p>\n\n        <ol>\n            <li>On paper, draw X-axis (zones 1-5) and Y-axis (difficulty 1-10)</li>\n            <li>Plot your final death counts for each zone</li>\n            <li>Connect the dots</li>\n        </ol>\n\n        <p>Ideal curve: starts low (Zone 1), rises gradually (Zones 2-3), peaks at Zone 4, drops slightly in Zone 5. If your curve spikes randomly or stays flat, more adjustments needed.</p>\n\n        <h2>Knowing When You're Done</h2>\n        <p>How do you know when to stop testing and refining? Here are the signs:</p>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li>You can complete the full game in under 8 minutes</li>\n            <li>Death counts follow a progressive curve (increasing toward Zone 4)</li>\n            <li>No single obstacle kills you more than 3-4 times</li>\n            <li>Each zone feels distinct and intentional</li>\n            <li>The ending feels satisfying</li>\n            <li>You're proud to show it to others</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>Perfection is impossible. \"Good enough to be proud of\" is the goal. If you've done five playthroughs, fixed major problems, and the game feels solid, you're done with flow testing.</p>\n\n        <h2>Documenting Your Final State</h2>\n        <p>Before finishing this mission, document your final game state:</p>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>Final completion time</strong>: _____ minutes</li>\n            <li><strong>Final death count</strong>: _____ total deaths</li>\n            <li><strong>Hardest zone</strong>: Zone _____</li>\n            <li><strong>Most fun zone</strong>: Zone _____</li>\n            <li><strong>Biggest improvement made</strong>: _____</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>Keep this documentation. When you revisit this project later or build future games, you'll want to remember what worked.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"try-it-box\">\n            <h3>Try It: The Reflection</h3>\n            <p>Write three sentences about what you learned from flow testing. What surprised you? What was harder than expected? What would you do differently next time? Reflection solidifies learning.</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>What Flow Testing Teaches</h2>\n        <p>Flow testing isn't just about fixing bugs. It's about learning to see your work objectively, to prioritize problems, to make data-driven decisions. These skills transfer to every game you'll ever make.</p>\n\n        <p>Professional game developers spend MONTHS in this phase. You're spending one mission, but you're learning the same process: build, test, identify, fix, repeat. That's game development.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"mission-check\">\n        <h2>Mission Check</h2>\n        <p>Before proceeding, verify:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Completed at least five full playthroughs of your game</li>\n            <li>Tracked data (deaths, times) for each zone</li>\n            <li>Identified and documented frustration points</li>\n            <li>Made adjustments to improve difficulty curve and flow</li>\n            <li>Verified all technical elements work (checkpoints, kill bricks, moving platforms)</li>\n            <li>Difficulty curve follows progressive pattern (peaks at Zone 4)</li>\n            <li>Game completion time is reasonable (4-10 minutes for skilled players)</li>\n            <li>No single obstacle causes excessive repeated deaths</li>\n        </ul>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"mission-bridge\">\n        <h2>What's Next</h2>\n        <p>Your island runner is built and refined.

But when you first spawn in, does it <em>feel</em> right? Does it capture the atmosphere of your actual place?</p>\n        <p>Lighting is the difference between a game that looks flat and generic, and one that feels alive and specific. Whether your island should feel like a sunny Caribbean beach, a foggy Pacific Northwest forest, or a golden desert canyon, lighting tells that story instantly.</p>\n        <p>In this mission, you'll become the director of photography for your island runner, using Roblox's Lighting service to set the perfect mood.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"mission-objective\">\n        <h2>Mission Objective</h2>\n        <p><strong>Configure Lighting service properties to establish mood and time of day that enhances the island theme</strong></p>\n        <p>By the end of this mission, your island will have:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>A specific time of day that matches your location's character</li>\n            <li>Atmospheric fog settings that add depth and mood</li>\n            <li>Ambient lighting that complements your color palette</li>\n            <li>Environmental effects that enhance immersion</li>\n        </ul>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"mission-content-main\">\n        <h2>Understanding the Lighting Service</h2>\n        <p>The Lighting service is a singleton object in Roblox that controls how light behaves across your entire game. Unlike individual lights you place in the world, the Lighting service sets the global rules—what time of day is it? How bright is the sun? Is there fog in the distance?</p>\n        <p>Think of it like this: if your game were a photograph, the Lighting service would be all the camera settings—exposure, white balance, filters. It doesn't matter what's in the photo; these settings affect everything.</p>\n\n        <h2>Step 1: Access the Lighting Service</h2>\n        <p>The Lighting service lives at the top level of your game hierarchy:</p>\n        <ol>\n            <li>Open the Explorer panel (View tab → Explorer)</li>\n            <li>Scroll to find <strong>Lighting</strong> in the tree (it's alphabetically sorted among services like Workspace, Players, etc.)</li>\n            <li>Click on <strong>Lighting</strong> to select it</li>\n            <li>Open the Properties panel (View tab → Properties)</li>\n        </ol>\n        <p>You should now see dozens of properties. Don't worry—we'll focus on the most important ones for establishing atmosphere.</p>\n\n        <h2>Step 2: Set Your Time of Day</h2>\n        <p>The <strong>ClockTime</strong> property controls where the sun is in the sky, using a 0-24 hour format (14 = 2:00 PM, 18 = 6:00 PM, etc.).</p>\n\n        <div class=\"property-guide\">\n            <h3>Choosing Your Time of Day</h3>\n            <ul>\n                <li><strong>Tropical/Beach Islands (14-16):</strong> Bright midday sun, sharp shadows, vibrant colors—think postcards</li>\n                <li><strong>Forest/Mountain Regions (8-10 or 16-18):</strong> Softer angles, longer shadows, golden or blue tones</li>\n                <li><strong>Desert/Canyon Areas (17-19):</strong> Golden hour warmth, dramatic shadows, orange-red tones</li>\n                <li><strong>Urban/City Settings (12-14):</strong> Neutral overhead lighting, clear visibility</li>\n                <li><strong>Mysterious/Spooky Locations (6-7 or 19-20):</strong> Dawn/dusk blues, low angle light, atmospheric</li>\n            </ul>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"try-it-box\">\n            <h3>Try It: Find Your Perfect Hour</h3>\n            <ol>\n                <li>In the Lighting properties, find <strong>ClockTime</strong></li>\n                <li>Enter a starting value based on the guide above</li>\n                <li>Press Play and run through your first zone</li>\n                <li>Stop, adjust the ClockTime by 1-2 hours, and test again</li>\n                <li>Repeat until the lighting feels right for your location</li>\n            </ol>\n            <p><em>Pro tip: Don't just stand still—run through your obstacles. Lighting changes how colors and shapes read during fast movement.</em></p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Step 3: Configure Fog for Depth</h2>\n        <p>Fog serves two purposes: it adds atmospheric depth (making distant objects fade), and it can hide the fact that your game world has boundaries. Even subtle fog improves immersion.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"property-guide\">\n            <h3>Key Fog Properties</h3>\n            <ul>\n                <li><strong>FogEnd:</strong> Distance (in studs) where objects are completely hidden by fog. Start with 1000-1500 for open areas, 500-800 for forests/cities.</li>\n                <li><strong>FogStart:</strong> Distance where fog begins to appear. Usually 0 (fog starts immediately) or FogEnd ÷ 2 for more gradual fade.</li>\n                <li><strong>FogColor:</strong> The color of the fog. Should complement your sky and overall palette—light blues for day, warm oranges for sunset, purple-grays for mystery.</li>\n            </ul>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"try-it-box\">\n            <h3>Try It: Add Atmospheric Fog</h3>\n            <ol>\n                <li>Find the <strong>FogEnd</strong> property and set it to 1200</li>\n                <li>Set <strong>FogStart</strong> to 0</li>\n                <li>Click the <strong>FogColor</strong> property to open the color picker</li>\n                <li>Choose a color that matches your time of day:\n                    <ul>\n                        <li>Midday: Light sky blue (RGB: 200, 220, 255)</li>\n                        <li>Golden hour: Warm peach (RGB: 255, 200, 150)</li>\n                        <li>Dawn/Dusk: Soft purple-blue (RGB: 150, 160, 200)</li>\n                    </ul>\n                </li>\n                <li>Test in Play mode—you should see distant platforms fade into fog</li>\n            </ol>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Step 4: Adjust Ambient Lighting</h2>\n        <p>Ambient lighting controls how much light fills in the shadows.

left, put Zone 2's on the right—keeps eyes moving</li>\n                <li><strong>Create focal points:</strong> Place more details near landmarks to draw attention</li>\n                <li><strong>Leave breathing room:</strong> Not every platform needs decoration—emptiness creates contrast</li>\n                <li><strong>Repeat signature elements:</strong> If palm trees are your

That takes courage, skill, and commitment.\n                </p>\n            </div>\n\n            <h3>What Comes Next?</h3>\n            <p>\n                This might be the end of your island runner project, but it doesn't have to be the end of\n                your game development journey.
